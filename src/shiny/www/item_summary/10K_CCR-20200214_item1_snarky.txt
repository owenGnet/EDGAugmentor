Original summary:

Well, well, well, CONSOL Coal Resources LP is still raking in the dough from coal, despite pesky regulations and competition.

But now they have to deal with even more regulations, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Toxic Release Inventory. And let's not forget about the health and safety laws they have to follow, which include purchasing additional safety equipment and engaging in additional training. But hey, at least they're making an effort to protect their miners from pinning, crushing, and striking hazards, and lowering their exposure to respirable coal mine dust. And let's not forget about the federal black lung benefits legislation, which requires them to make payments to disabled miners and certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease. Oh, and they're also liable under various state statutes for their portion of black lung claims.

But who cares about all that when there's coal to be mined, right CONSOL? Keep on prioritizing profit over everything else, including the health and safety of your employees. 

Refined summary:

CONSOL Coal Resources LP may be making a killing from coal, but pesky regulations and competition are making it harder for them to prioritize profit over everything else, including the health and safety of their employees. They have to deal with even more regulations now, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Toxic Release Inventory. And let's not forget about the health and safety laws they have to follow, which include purchasing additional safety equipment and engaging in additional training.

But hey, at least they're making an effort to protect their miners from pinning, crushing, and striking hazards, and lowering their exposure to respirable coal mine dust. They also have to make payments to disabled miners and certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease, and are liable under various state statutes for their portion of black lung claims. And let's not forget that they don't even have any employees of their own, relying instead on CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries to provide direct support to their operations. But who cares about all that when there's coal to be mined, right CONSOL? Keep on prioritizing profit over everything else, including the health and safety of your employees.
