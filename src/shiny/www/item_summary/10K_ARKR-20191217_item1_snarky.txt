Looks like this struggling New York corporation is still trying to make a name for themselves in the cutthroat hospitality industry by investing in racetracks and sports betting.

They're hoping to score big with exclusive food and beverage concessions at gaming facilities, but they've had some setbacks with landlord issues in Florida and a failed restaurant in Boston. And let's not forget about the joys of government regulation and labor laws that could potentially disrupt their operations. Plus, they have to make sure their facilities comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act and get approval from the New York State Liquor Authority for any major shareholder transactions. Oh, and did we mention their business is highly seasonal and dependent on good weather? Good luck with all that, guys.

But hey, at least they make their financial reports available online for free.
