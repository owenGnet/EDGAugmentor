Well, Art's-Way Manufacturing is still chugging along in the agricultural equipment industry, serving niche markets and making strategic acquisitions. They also have a Modular Buildings segment that can design and produce high-tech buildings more quickly than conventional firms, and a Tools segment that faces competition from offshore products but offers the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories in North America. Oh, and they pay royalties for their use of certain manufacturing rights and have to comply with various environmental regulations. They employ a total of 125 people, but who knows if that's their peak employment during the year. So, if you're in the market for some niche farm equipment or high-tech modular buildings and want to support a company that pays royalties and follows environmental regulations, Art's-Way Manufacturing might be worth checking out.
