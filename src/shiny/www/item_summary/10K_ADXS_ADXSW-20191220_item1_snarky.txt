Well, it turns out that our regulatory nightmare is just the tip of the iceberg.

We also have to worry about fierce competition from other companies with more experience and resources, as well as the timing of market introduction for our potential immunotherapies. And let's not forget about the importance of product efficacy, safety, administration, reliability, acceptance, availability, price, and patent position in the market. But hey, at least our management team has extensive experience in oncology development and we have a small but dedicated team of employees. We'll just have to keep renting offices and laboratories to support our business and hope for the best. It's a tough world out there, folks.
