The company owns and operates various restaurants and bars across the US, offering extensive menus with high-quality foods at moderate prices.

They have shifted to larger destination properties with distinctive architectural and design elements. Notable locations include the Broadway Burger Bar and Grill in Atlantic City, The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, and JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach. The company may take advantage of favorable opportunities for expansion, depending on financing and other factors. They also have investments in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC and have a long-term agreement to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities at the Meadowlands. Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef, with financial and management control maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems.

The company strives to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials, and other supplies and services for their operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. However, the hospitality industry is highly competitive, and the company faces competition from both national and locally owned competitors with greater financial resources. The company employs 2,145 persons, and changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect their labor costs. The company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws affecting their business, including licensing and regulation by governmental authorities, alcoholic beverage control regulations, and labor laws. The company must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state statutes.

The business is highly seasonal, with the second quarter being the poorest performing quarter, but this has been partially offset by locations in Florida. The company makes available free of charge through their website their annual and quarterly reports, statements of beneficial ownership of securities, and amendments to these reports and statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) and Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
