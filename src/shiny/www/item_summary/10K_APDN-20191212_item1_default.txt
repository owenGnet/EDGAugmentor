The existing summary remains accurate and relevant, but additional context highlights potential challenges for Applied DNA Sciences in obtaining adequate coverage and reimbursement for its products due to varying pricing and reimbursement requirements in foreign countries. The European Union, for example, provides options for member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control prices. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any country with price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for Applied DNA Sciences' products. The impact of other government regulations, such as those related to employee safety and health matters, are also noted. As of September 30, 2019, the company had 51 employees and expenses related to travel, marketing, salaries, and general overhead will be increased as necessary to support growth in revenue.
