Anixa Biosciences may be ahead of the game with their CchekÂ™ cancer detection platform and breast cancer vaccine, but they're about to face some serious competition. With millions of women at risk of breast cancer worldwide, larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions are all vying for a piece of the pie. And let's not forget about potential mergers and acquisitions that could concentrate even more resources among a smaller number of competitors. Good luck, Anixa, you're going to need it.
