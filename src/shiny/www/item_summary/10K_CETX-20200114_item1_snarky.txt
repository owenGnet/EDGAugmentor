Well, well, well, looks like Cemtrex is just like any other company with a bunch of employees and some insurance policies.

They sell their products globally and use various marketing strategies, including social media and trade shows. They have a diverse range of customers in various industries, but no one customer accounts for more than 10% of their sales. And of course, they have to comply with government regulations like any other business. Oh, and it takes them anywhere from two to twelve months to get an order from initial customer contact. Exciting stuff.
