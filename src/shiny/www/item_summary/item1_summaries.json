The company's revenues are primarily generated in the United States, with a smaller portion coming from Canada, Central America, Asia, Europe, Mexico, South America, and Other. The company has changed its organizational structure with the acquisition of Fulton and the sale of the Cable TV segment, resulting in the Wireless Infrastructure Services and Telecommunications segments. The Wireless segment provides installation and upgrade services for cell sites and small cells for 5G, while the Telecommunications segment offers new and used telecommunication networking equipment, repair and testing services, and decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment. The company's sales and marketing are predominantly performed by its experienced internal sales and customer service staff, outside sales representatives, and many online sales channel platforms. The company believes its investment in on-hand inventory, product supply channels, and experienced sales and customer service team create a competitive advantage for them. The Wireless segment experiences increased demand on certain product offerings during the months between late spring and early fall when severe weather or consistent rain tends to be more prominent than at other times during the year. The company faces competition from other wireless service companies and numerous resellers in the marketplace. The Telco segment differentiates itself from other resellers in the marketplace by offering a broad range of new, refurbished, and used inventory, sourcing unique and high demand inventory, offering repair and testing capabilities, having experienced sales support staff, having a sales force with strong technical knowledge, and providing multiple services for customers. Working capital practices differ by segment, with the Wireless segment utilizing quick payment accounts receivable programs and the Telco segment focusing on inventory and accounts receivable. The company has sufficient funds available from cash on hand, future cash flows, quick payment accounts receivable programs, and the bank revolving line of credit to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future. The company is not dependent on a single or few customers to support its business on an ongoing basis company-wide, with sales to its largest customer accounting for approximately 12% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2019 and sales to its largest five customers accounting for 37% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2019. The company had 188 employees at September 30, 2019, and management considers its relationships with its employees to be excellent.",

        "default": "Advaxis, a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) Technology antigen delivery products for immunotherapy, aggressively prosecutes and defends its patents and proprietary technology. The company has Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) with the FDA for several products and intends to use expedited FDA programs for serious conditions. However, the successful commercialization of new drug products depends on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time, and even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable policies and rates may be implemented in the future. Additionally, manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States, including CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General, and HHS Office for Civil Rights, among others. Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors may expose the company to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which the company markets, sells, and distributes any drugs for which it obtains marketing approval. The company's future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for its products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for its products, and the sale and marketing of its product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under these laws. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit fraudulent actions and false claims related to healthcare benefit programs, including private third-party payors. The ACA also imposes new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and \"transfers of value\" provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other hand. The company may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which it conducts business. Similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. In order to distribute products commercially, the company must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state. All of the company's activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions could prevent or delay marketing approval of Advaxis' product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the company's ability to profitably sell any approved products. The Affordable Care Act, for example, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extend Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, provide for mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted, and there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Congress and the current administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration recently released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. Advaxis' collaborations, partnerships, and agreements with other companies are a key component of its corporate strategy, and ongoing clinical studies and agreements with leading oncology pharmaceutical companies help validate the potential of Lm Technology in cancer treatment protocols. However, before Advaxis can market its products outside the United States, it must gain regulatory approval from the respective authorities in each country, and the requirements for clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely. Additionally, individual states in the United States have been passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, which could impact Advaxis' ability to profitably sell its products. The company has entered into agreements with multiple third-party organizations to handle the manufacturing, testing, and distribution of product candidates, and has constructed a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and laboratory to develop and manufacture clinical-grade products. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition, and Advaxis faces competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others. The competition includes investigational new drugs and/or products developed using other technologies, some of which have completed numerous clinical trials. The speed with which Advaxis can develop immunotherapies, complete preclinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. The company's management team has extensive experience in oncology development, including contract research, development, manufacturing and commercialization across a board range of science, technologies, and process operations. The company has 35 full-time employees engaged in research and development activities, finance, business development, facilities, human resources, and administrative support. The company rents necessary offices and laboratories to support its business.",

Anixa is currently conducting activities to support marketing of the test, including the development of marketing materials, education of key opinion leaders in urology, and development of a reimbursement path for the test. Anixa has also formed a subsidiary, Certainty Therapeutics, to develop immuno-therapy drugs against cancer and have initially focused on the development of a treatment for ovarian cancer using CAR-T technology. Anixa is working with researchers at Moffitt to complete studies necessary to submit an IND application with the FDA. While the results of the studies are positive, there are many uncertainties in drug development, and most drugs fail to reach commercialization. Anixa's long term vision is to have one or more tests based upon the Cchek\u2122 platform to serve each of the markets identified above, including confirmatory testing, treatment monitoring, and recurrence testing. Anixa is also developing a breast cancer vaccine that targets alpha-lactalbumin, a protein present in healthy breast tissue only when a woman is lactating and disappears when she stops nursing her child. The vaccine aims to prevent breast tumors from forming and is currently being tested in clinical grade materials. However, Anixa faces intense and dynamic competition from larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by mergers and acquisitions, which may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Anixa's competitors. Anixa's commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that Anixa may develop.

The Agricultural Products segment offers a wide range of products for feed processing, crop production, land management, sugar beet harvesting, hay and forage, and manure spreading. The company sells its products through independent dealers in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia. The Modular Buildings segment produces custom-designed modular buildings for various uses, and the Tools segment produces and sells standard and specialized tools for industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas piping, and appliances. The company also exports its products to eleven foreign countries, accounting for 5.0% of consolidated sales during the 2019 fiscal year. The company's backlog of orders has increased across all three segments and is up approximately 266% in total compared to the same time last year. The Agricultural Products segment has developed several new products, including a 215-bushel grinder mixer, two new manure spreaders, a sonar leveling axle for sugar beet harvesters, a 40-foot commercial forage box, and a hemp drying box. The company competes in a highly competitive agricultural equipment industry but believes its competitive strengths, including serving smaller markets in specific product areas, allow it to compete effectively. The company sells its products through a network of approximately 1,100 independent dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia. The Modular Buildings segment's competitive strength is its ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms. The Tools segment faces competition from offshore products and emerging technologies, but the company's ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories in North America and produce special, engineered, value-added products in volume with short lead times sets it apart from competitors. The company's raw materials for its various segments are acquired from domestic and foreign sources, and it has OEM supplier agreements with Case New Holland, Honey Bee, and Agco. The company does not typically rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers, and it maintains manufacturing rights on several products and trademarks covering product identification. The company pays royalties for its use of certain manufacturing rights and has licensing and royalty agreements with Martin Harvesting, LLC and Spreader, LLC.

And let's not forget about the federal black lung benefits legislation, which requires them to make payments to disabled miners and certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease. Oh, and they're also liable under various state statutes for their portion of black lung claims. But who cares about all that when there's coal to be mined, right CONSOL? Keep on prioritizing profit over everything else, including the health and safety of your employees.\n\nRefined summary:\n\nCONSOL Coal Resources LP may be making a killing from coal, but pesky regulations and competition are making it harder for them to prioritize profit over everything else, including the health and safety of their employees. They have to deal with even more regulations now, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Toxic Release Inventory. And let's not forget about the health and safety laws they have to follow, which include purchasing additional safety equipment and engaging in additional training. But hey, at least they're making an effort to protect their miners from pinning, crushing, and striking hazards, and lowering their exposure to respirable coal mine dust. They also have to make payments to disabled miners and certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease, and are liable under various state statutes for their portion of black lung claims. And let's not forget that they don't even have any employees of their own, relying instead on CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries to provide direct support to their operations. But who cares about all that when there's coal to be mined, right CONSOL? Keep on prioritizing profit over everything else, including the health and safety of your employees."

        "default": "Cemtrex is a multi-industry technology company with two business segments: Advanced Technologies (AT) and Industrial Services (IS). The AT segment delivers cutting-edge technologies in IoT, wearables, and smart devices, and the IS segment offers single-source expertise and services for rigging, millwrighting, in-plant maintenance, equipment erection, relocation, and disassembly to diversified customers. The company recently made strategic decisions to exit its Electronics Manufacturing and environmental products businesses. Cemtrex also purchased shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase additional shares of common stock of Vicon Industries, Inc. in a private resale transaction, resulting in its beneficial ownership of approximately 72% of Vicon's outstanding shares of common stock. The company accounts for Vicon using the consolidation method of accounting. The company sold its Electronics Manufacturing business and subsidiaries for total consideration of \u20ac6,367,199 and entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the sale of Griffin Filters to Ducon Technologies, Inc. for total consideration of $550,000. The Company's principal customers are engaged in automotive, medical, industrial automation, power, manufacturing, chemical, packaging, printing, electronics, mining, and metallurgical processing. The company employs approximately 273 full-time employees and approximately 24 part-time employees. The company faces substantial competition in each of its products and services and principal markets, and relies on a combination of trade secrets and know-how to protect its intellectual property. The company sells its products globally and relies on various marketing strategies to reach its customers. The company intends to continue utilizing its resource capabilities to deliver exceptional value for its customers, shareholders, and employees, and seeks to expand its products and services as well as enter into new markets through strategic acquisitions.",
        "snarky": "Well, well, well, looks like Cemtrex is just like any other company with a bunch of employees and some insurance policies. They sell their products globally and use various marketing strategies, including social media and trade shows. They have a diverse range of customers in various industries, but no one customer accounts for more than 10% of their sales. And of course, they have to comply with government regulations like any other business. Oh, and it takes them anywhere from two to twelve months to get an order from initial customer contact. Exciting stuff."
