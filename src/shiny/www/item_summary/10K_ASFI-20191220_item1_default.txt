As of September 30, 2019, Asta Funding had 56 full-time employees and was not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

The company's website provides access to its SEC filings, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, amendments thereto, and other SEC reports. No part of the website is incorporated by reference into the report. Asta Funding is subject to extensive federal and state regulations, including laws that regulate consumer debt collection activity. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement authority over entities involved in consumer financial markets, including debt collectors.

Asta Funding needs to understand the oversight that the CFPB brings and prepare for a potential audit, which can cost time and money. The proposed rule under the FDCPA could limit debt collectors to no more than seven attempts by telephone per week to reach a consumer about a specific debt.
