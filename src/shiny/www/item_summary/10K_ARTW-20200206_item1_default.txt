Art's-Way Manufacturing is a Delaware corporation that has been manufacturing farm equipment since 1956.

The company has three operating segments: Agricultural Products, Modular Buildings, and Tools. The Agricultural Products segment offers a wide range of products for feed processing, crop production, land management, sugar beet harvesting, hay and forage, and manure spreading. The company sells its products through independent dealers in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia. The Modular Buildings segment produces custom-designed modular buildings for various uses, and the Tools segment produces and sells standard and specialized tools for industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas piping, and appliances. The company also exports its products to eleven foreign countries, accounting for 5.0% of consolidated sales during the 2019 fiscal year.

The company's backlog of orders has increased across all three segments and is up approximately 266% in total compared to the same time last year. The Agricultural Products segment has developed several new products, including a 215-bushel grinder mixer, two new manure spreaders, a sonar leveling axle for sugar beet harvesters, a 40-foot commercial forage box, and a hemp drying box. The company competes in a highly competitive agricultural equipment industry but believes its competitive strengths, including serving smaller markets in specific product areas, allow it to compete effectively. The company sells its products through a network of approximately 1,100 independent dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia. The Modular Buildings segment's competitive strength is its ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms.

The Tools segment faces competition from offshore products and emerging technologies, but the company's ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories in North America and produce special, engineered, value-added products in volume with short lead times sets it apart from competitors. The company's raw materials for its various segments are acquired from domestic and foreign sources, and it has OEM supplier agreements with Case New Holland, Honey Bee, and Agco. The company does not typically rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers, and it maintains manufacturing rights on several products and trademarks covering product identification. The company pays royalties for its use of certain manufacturing rights and has licensing and royalty agreements with Martin Harvesting, LLC and Spreader, LLC. The Modular Buildings segment must comply with state building codes and federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection.

As of November 30, 2019, the company employed approximately 79 employees in its Agricultural Products segment, 24 employees in its Tools segment, and 22 employees in its Modular Buildings segment.
