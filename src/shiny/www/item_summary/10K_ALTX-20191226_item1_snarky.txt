Altex Industries is a holding company with one employee that owns interests in onshore oil and gas properties. They rely on information provided by operators and could be responsible for all liabilities associated with a property. Their production operations are only affected by competitive factors if it affects demand and prices. They are subject to environmental laws and regulations but don't think they have any material exposure to liability. Basically, they're a small fish in a big pond and hope they don't get sued for polluting the environment.
