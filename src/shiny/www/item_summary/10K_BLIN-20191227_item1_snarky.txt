Looks like Bridgeline Digital is still offering their Unbound platform, but now they've added even more digital services to their arsenal.

They've got customer retention programs, new lead generation programs, and social media programs to keep you hooked. And if that's not enough, they've also been on a shopping spree, acquiring Seevolution Inc. and Stantive Technologies Group Inc. But don't worry, they still can't help you with your social skills. Oh, and they want you to know that their platform is flexible, easy to use, and competitively priced compared to their competitors. Plus, they own some trade secrets and trademarks, but no patents.

If you want to read more about their business ethics and committee charters, you can check out their website or visit the SEC's Public Reference Room.
