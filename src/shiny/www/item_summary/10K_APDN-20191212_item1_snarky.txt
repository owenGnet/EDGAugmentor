Well, Applied DNA Sciences Inc. may have thought entering the drug and biologic product market was tough, but they better brace themselves for the regulatory nightmare that awaits them. Not only do they have to deal with the strict regulations of the FDA and other agencies, but they also have to navigate the pricing and reimbursement policies of foreign countries, which can vary widely and may not be favorable to their products. And let's not forget about the joy of complying with various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and environmental laws. But hey, at least they have 51 employees to help them out, and they're not planning any significant capital expenditures for government regulation matters. So, good luck to Applied DNA Sciences Inc. in their quest for profitability, and may they never forget the joy of dealing with government bureaucracy.
