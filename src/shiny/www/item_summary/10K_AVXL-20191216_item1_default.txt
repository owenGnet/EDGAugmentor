Anavex Life Sciences is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicine for CNS diseases with high unmet needs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, and Rett syndrome.

Their lead compound, ANAVEX®2-73, has shown potential as a neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive, and anti-depressive therapeutic agent in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and has demonstrated significant improvements in a disease-modifying animal model of Parkinson's disease. Anavex has completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for ANAVEX®2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients, which met both primary and secondary endpoints and established a concentration-effect relationship between ANAVEX®2-73 and study measurements. They have also initiated a larger Phase 2b/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer's disease, incorporating genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the Phase 2a study. Anavex's research and development pipeline includes several other compounds in different stages of pre-clinical study, including ANAVEX®3-71, a preclinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has been shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimer's disease models.

Anavex has also developed compounds with potential application to several specific indications, including Parkinson's disease, Rett syndrome, neuropathic and visceral pain, and prostate and pancreatic cancer. Anavex holds ownership or exclusive rights to several patents and trademarks related to their drug candidates and research programs. However, the process of obtaining regulatory approval for potential drug compounds requires substantial time and financial resources, and Anavex's competitors include major pharmaceutical companies. Sales outside the United States of potential drug compounds developed by Anavex will also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing, which vary widely from country to country and typically take several years and significant resources. Anavex's research and development expenses have historically been significant, and they are advised by scientists and physicians with relevant experience.

Anavex currently has sixteen full-time employees and retains several independent contractors. Their website contains information on their financial statements and reports, but the contents of the website are not incorporated into their reports.
