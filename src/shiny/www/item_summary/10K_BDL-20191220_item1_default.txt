Flanigan's Enterprises has updated information on their insurance policies and competition in the liquor and hospitality industries.

They are uninsured against liability claims in excess of $7,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, but are in discussions to secure general liability and excess liability insurance for the period after the expiration of their current policies. They also have property insurance with a fixed deductible of $100,000 plus 5% of all insured losses for windstorm losses and a $10,000 deductible for all other property losses, and are in discussions to secure property insurance for the period after the expiration of their current policy. Flanigan's operates package liquor stores and restaurants under two service marks, "Big Daddy's Liquors" and "Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill," both of which are federally registered trademarks owned by them. They employ 1,870 persons, and none of their employees are represented by collective bargaining organizations. The Board of Directors may make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions, and the company's website address is https://www.flanigans.net.

Flanigan's is not aware of any environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect their earnings or competitive position, but cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations on their operations.
