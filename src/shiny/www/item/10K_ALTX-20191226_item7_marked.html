Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</div>

<div style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.25; font-weight: bold;">Financial Condition</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;">In <mark data-entity="norp">FY19</mark> operating activities provided $5,000 cash, and the Company used $13,000 cash to acquire 166,322 shares of its common stock. In <mark data-entity="org">FY18 the Company</mark> used $55,000 cash in operating activities and
      $20,000 cash to acquire 245,900 shares of its common stock. Consequently, cash balances decreased $8,000 and $75,000 in <mark data-entity="norp">FY19</mark> and FY18, respectively. At <mark data-entity="date">September 30, 2019 and 2018</mark>, other accrued expenses include $1,024,000 in salary payable to the
      Company’s president, pursuant to his employment agreement, that the president has elected to defer, as well as $49,000 in related accrued payroll tax.</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;">The Company is likely to experience negative cash flow from operations unless and until the Company invests in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in another venture that produces sufficient
      cash flow from operations. With the exception of capital expenditures related to production acquisitions or drilling or recompletion activities or an investment in another venture that produces cash flow from operations, none of which are currently
      planned, the cash flows that could result from such acquisitions, activities, or investments, and the possibility of a material change in the current level of interest rates or of oil and gas prices, the Company knows of no trends or demands,
      commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Except for cash generated by the operation of the Company's producing oil and
      gas properties, asset sales, and interest income, the Company has no internal or external sources of liquidity other than its working capital. At <mark data-entity="date">December 26, 2019</mark>, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;">The Company regularly assesses its exposure to both environmental liability and RR&amp;D. The Company does not believe that it currently has any material exposure to environmental liability or to
      RR&amp;D, net of salvage value, although this cannot be assured.</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.25; font-weight: bold;">Results of Operations</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;">In <mark data-entity="norp">FY19</mark> the Company wrote down the carrying value of it oil and gas properties by recognizing an impairment provision of $24,000. Interest income increased from $30,000 in FY18 to $51,000 in <mark data-entity="norp">FY19</mark>       because of higher realized interest rates on cash balances. Included in other income in <mark data-entity="norp">FY19</mark> was $63,000 in bonus payments for undeveloped acreage leased to <mark data-entity="ordinal">third</mark> parties.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;"><br style="line-height: 1.25;"/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;">At the current levels of net oil and gas production, cash balances, interest rates, and oil and gas prices, the Company’s revenue is unlikely to exceed its expenses. Unless and until the Company
      invests a substantial portion of its cash balances in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in <mark data-entity="cardinal">one</mark> or more other ventures that produce revenue and net income, the Company is likely to experience net losses. With the exception of unanticipated
      RR&amp;D, unanticipated environmental expense, and possible changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices, the Company is not aware of any other trends, events, or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material
      impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.</div>
