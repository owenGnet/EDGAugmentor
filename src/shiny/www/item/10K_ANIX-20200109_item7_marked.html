   In fiscal year 2019, we recorded revenue of $250,000 from <mark data-entity="cardinal">one</mark> license agreement.  In fiscal year 2018, we recorded revenue of <mark data-entity="money">approximately $1,113,000</mark> from <mark data-entity="cardinal">two</mark> license agreements.  These license agreements each provided for a <mark data-entity="cardinal">one</mark> time, non-recurring, lump sum payment in exchange for non-exclusive retroactive and future licenses, and/or covenants not to sue.  Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we have no further obligations with respect to the granted intellectual property rights, including no obligation to maintain or upgrade the technology, or provide future support or services.  Accordingly, the performance obligations from these licenses were satisfied and 100% of the revenue was recognized upon execution of the license agreement.  As discussed in Note 1 to our <mark data-entity="org">Consolidated Financial Statements</mark>  as part of our legacy operations, the Company remains engaged in limited patent licensing activities which we do not expect to be a significant part of our ongoing operations or revenue.

    The <mark data-entity="org">Black-Scholes</mark> pricing model and <mark data-entity="org">the Monte Carlo Simulation</mark> we use to estimate fair values requires valuation assumptions of expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yield.
   </font>
   The expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.  For employees we use the simplified method, which is a weighted average of the vesting term and contractual term, to determine expected term.  The simplified method was adopted since we do not believe that historical experience is representative of future performance because of the impact of the changes in our operations and the change in terms from historical options.  For consultants we use the contract term for expected term.  We estimate the expected volatility of our shares of common stock based upon the historical volatility of our share price over a period of time equal to the expected term of the grants.  We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on the implied yield available on the applicable grant date of a <mark data-entity="org">U.S. Treasury</mark> note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants.  We made the dividend yield assumption based on our history of not paying dividends and our expectation not to pay dividends in the future.

   We will reconsider use of the <mark data-entity="org">Black-Scholes</mark> pricing model and Monte Carlo Simulation if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates other models would be more appropriate.  If factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.  See Note 2 to the <mark data-entity="org">Consolidated Financial Statements</mark> for additional information.
