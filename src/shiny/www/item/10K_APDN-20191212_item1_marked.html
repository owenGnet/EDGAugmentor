<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Using its proprietary large-scale PCR based manufacturing
technology and systems, Applied DNA Sciences Inc. (“Applied DNA”, the “Company” or “we”)
manufactures large quantities of linear DNA for use in its proprietary products as well as for sale to third parties. The
Company manufactures non-biological DNA-based molecular taggants for use in its proprietary supply chain security,
anticounterfeiting, brand protection and law enforcement products.  With secure non-biological taggants, high-resolution
DNA authentication, and comprehensive reporting, the Company’s SigNature® molecular taggant technologies deliver
what we believe to be the greatest levels of security, deterrence and legal recourse strength, making Applied DNA a leader in
supply chain provenance technologies. The Company’s 98% percent owned subsidiary LineaRx, Inc. (“LRx”)
manufactures larger DNA constructs used in preclinical biotherapeutic applications, which are primarily sold to third
parties. Through LRx, the Company supplies PCR produced linear DNA for use in preclinical biotherapeutic applications
including CAR T/TCR, RNA manufacture, DNA-based vaccines and gene therapies, as well as in vitro diagnostics. LRx seeks to
supplant the use of plasmid derived DNA with PCR-produced linear DNA in biotherapeutic and diagnostic applications, and to
develop, acquire and commercialize, alone or with partners, a diverse portfolio of nucleic acid-based biotherapeutics and
diagnostics that we believe will improve the efficacy, safety and cost of existing and newly developed biotherapeutics and
diagnostics.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The core technologies of our supply chain security business
are supplied as tag, test and track solutions for large complex supply chains. Our tag, test and track solutions allow our customers
to use molecular tags to mark objects in a unique manner that we believe cannot be replicated, and then identify these objects
by detecting the absence or presence of the molecular tag. We believe that our disruptive tracking platform offers broad commercial
relevance across many industry verticals. Our underlying strategy in the tagging business is to become a solutions provider for
supply chains of process industries in which contracts for our products and services are typically larger and of longer duration
as compared to our historic norms, where the benefits to customers and consumers are more significant, and where our forensic security
and traceability offer a unique and protected value. Consumers, governments and companies are demanding details about the systems

are directly addressing new threats and opportunities presented by this question: Where do these goods come from? This is the question
and the concerns we are beginning to address for a growing number of companies. We supply key building blocks for creating secure
supply chains with traceability of goods, which in turn can help ensure integrity in supply, honest sales and marketing claims,

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Supply chain security</i></b></p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Supply chains are the systems used by companies to obtain products
and services for resale, their own consumption or as a component in a product or service that they then resell. Supply chains often
include the sourcing of <mark data-esg="env">raw materials</mark>, their processing in various stages to create products, and transportation and logistics
to move goods both within the supply chain process and to the final consumer. Many different companies may be part of a supply
chain, and often the owner of the supply chain has limited ability to oversee and supervise all components of its supply chain.
Supply chain security refers to efforts to enhance the security of the supply chain. It combines traditional practices of supply
chain management with the security requirements driven by threats such as terrorism, piracy and theft. We focus on two particular
parts of supply chain security, the identity of goods to detect substitution of specified inputs with something else, often a cheaper,
inferior input and the traceability of goods to a point in its lifecycle. For example, a company might specify that sheets be made
of high <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> pima cotton but the company that wove the material for the sheets substituted cheaper and inferior upland cotton.
We call a supply chain with such security problems a leaky supply chain. Leaky supply chains create significant and growing problems
to companies in a wide range of industries as well as governments and individuals worldwide. Large retailers assemble sprawling
networks of suppliers in developing countries to produce their goods at cheaper cost, underscoring the difficulties of policing
a global supply chain. This is a global problem that only appears to be increasing. Leaky supply chains allow materials to become
diluted, diverted or counterfeited, devaluing corporate reputations, potentially causing <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark> and safety concerns, and hindering
investment, and may cost hundreds of thousands of people their livelihood every year. In addition, a company with a leaky supply
chain has essentially been cheated, since they paid a premium price for an inferior substitution.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As more and more companies begin to address the problem of supply
chain security, we expect that different systems will compete to be the leading standards by which products can be tracked across
world markets. To ensure only genuine products are entering the marketplace requires cutting edge technology. Historically, leaky
supply chains and other types of <mark data-esg="gov">fraud</mark> have been combated by embedding various authentication systems and rare and easily distinguishable
materials into products; technologies such as radio frequency identification (“RFID”) devices, holograms or integrated
circuit chips onto packaging; magnetic strips in automatic teller machine cards; banknote threads on currency; elemental taggants
in explosives; and radioactivity and rare molecules in crude oil. We believe each of these techniques offer a trade-off for the
user among security level, application variety, cost, ease of implementation, ease of use, information content, and other parameters.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Establishing a strong brand is pivotal to business success,
as it is how a company is perceived by the customer. We believe that protecting that brand is as important. Counterfeiting affects
brands across the globe and effective brand protection strategy has become imperative for companies. Many customers do not even
realize that they have a counterfeit product, attributing the poor <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> to the brand thus tarnishing its name. A recent Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (June 23, 2017) reiterates a number of trends that have been evident for
more than a decade – virtually all brands are being counterfeited, and counterfeit and pirated products are originating from
virtually all economies on all continents. Counterfeiters are improving their logistics networks, manipulating transit routes,
exploiting governance gaps and taking advantage of the huge growth in online shopping, thereby underlining the need for secure
supply chains to protect brands. Consumer safety and satisfaction, brand reputation and revenues can be adversely impacted by counterfeiting.
Our SigNature molecular tags can be applied to many products, affording quick and definitive identification of authentic products,
and aiding in brand protection efforts.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have emerged as a
new class of drugs and biologics for treating unmet medical needs. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics, which includes adoptive
cell therapy, gene therapy, DNA-based vaccines and RNA-based therapies, are  in our opinion the foundation for the
current fast-paced medical revolution. All nucleic acid-based therapeutics are driven by DNA, which is required in large
scale. As of January 2018, almost 2600 nucleic acid-based therapeutic clinical trials have been completed, are ongoing or
have been approved worldwide (The Journal of Gene Medicine: Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide to 2017; An Update -March
25, 2018). To date, DNA for nucleic acid-based therapeutics has been supplied via bacterial plasmids. Bacterial plasmid must
be purified to remove bacterial toxins and native bacterial DNA before therapeutic use, a process that increases
manufacturing time and complexity. We believe PCR-produced DNA is a better alternative than plasmid DNA for use in nucleic
acid-based therapeutics because it does not use bacteria in its manufacturing process. Through the use of our PCR-based
technology and systems, we feel we are well situated to supply DNA to the growing nucleic acid-based therapeutics market.
Therapeutics utilizing our PCR produced linear DNA will require clinical trials and approval by the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) which may not occur for many years, if at all.</p>

that can be used to fortify brand protection efforts; strengthen supply chain security; and mark, track and convict criminals.
Through our SigNature® molecular tags, custom DNA sequences can be embedded into a wide range of host carriers including <mark data-esg="env">natural</mark>
and synthetic fibers, ink, varnish, thread, metal coatings, and pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. SigNature® molecular tags
can be made resistant to challenging environments such as heat, cold, vibration, abrasion, organic solvents, chemicals, UV radiation
and other extreme environmental conditions, and so can be identified for numerous years after being embedded directly, or into
media applied or attached to the item to be marked. Each individual molecular tag is recorded and stored in a secure database so
that we can later detect it using a simple in-field test, or in our laboratories to obtain definitive proof of the presence or
absence of a specific SigNature® molecular tag (e.g., one designed to mark a particular product). Our in-lab forensic testing
capability delivers an expert witness Certificate of DNA Authentication (“CODA”). Because DNA is one of the densest
information carriers known, and can be amplified with high fidelity, only minute quantities of SigNature® molecular tags are
necessary for successful analysis and authentication. As a result, SigNature® molecular tags can fold seamlessly into production

and authentication. Cotton classification and the authentication of cotton species after cotton has left its place of origin are
issues of global significance, important to brand owners and to governments that must regulate the international cotton trade.
We believe that the use of endogenous DNA to identify the cotton fiber content in textile supply chains, along with the SigNature®

requirements which differ by vertical market, company business process and IT environment. Basic functions offered include molecular
tag inventory management, program training and communications, a database of marked items information, associated documents and
images, chain of custody and location tracking, sample authentication processing and CODA downloads, and other administrative functions.
Designed for either cloud or local operation, the system supports mobile data capture using bar codes or other technologies. The
system is architected as the controller and repository for other validation and authentication devices such as our SigNify®
DNA Readers, DNA Transfer Systems, Cannabis Tracking Systems and other third-party devices and is designed to share data with third
party applications through standard interfaces.</p>

recycled polyester, viscose and other synthetic products used in apparel, footwear and home textiles globally. The molecular tag
is robust, and inert. It has no impact on the form or function of <mark data-esg="env">raw materials</mark> or end products and is persistent throughout the
manufacturing process. The information content of each unique SigNature® T tag can be assigned with precision to a supply chain
objective. Thus, SigNature® T tagged materials have their own identity and may offer, for example, a unique story of where,
when, and/or how they were made. The flexible nature of SigNature® T technology facilitates easy addition of the tag at virtually

T-cell immuno-oncology therapies, wherein autologous or allogeneic cells are collected and genetically modified to kill
cancer cells. Two CAR T-cell therapies have recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of B-cell malignancies. These
approved therapies have demonstrated high efficacy in published studies. The CAR T-cell market is undergoing rapid growth,
with over $20 billion in recent M&amp;A activity (January 2018, Juno Therapeutics acquired by Celgene for $9 billion; August

we typically conduct feasibility and pilot testing to ensure that DNA tagging methods are compatible with the customer’s
manufacturing and logistic processes, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. In some cases, the DNA incorporation
methods may undergo wash-out and/or adherence tests to ensure that DNA can be authenticated on a product even if it is subjected

those new DNA formulations into products, to provide for better adhesion of DNA onto surfaces and when appropriate, better blending

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">However, there are events that are outside of our control that
pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual
property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. The efforts we have
taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property
rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.
Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating
results. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of
these innovations. Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later
turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained from one of our issued patents
will be insufficient or deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets.
This secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to
lose the <mark data-esg="gov">competitive</mark> advantage resulting from these trade secrets.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property
rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate.
This litigation could involve proceedings instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission,
as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties. Intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive,
and these expenses, as well as the consequences should we not prevail, could seriously harm our business. If a third party claims
an intellectual property right to technology we use, we might need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our
products and processes, <mark data-esg="soc">pay</mark> license fees or cease our affected business activities. Although we might under these circumstances
attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all.</p>

months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA or BLA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the

the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit
substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the
application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the
FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews
an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the drug or biologic is safe and effective and whether the facility in

contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require
additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional
information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when

approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to
recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences

involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with
the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance
with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before
being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose
reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> control to maintain
cGMP compliance.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The FDA is currently exercising enforcement discretion
over the regulation of Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”), such as our iCTC capture assay. If the FDA were
to begin enforcement, our product would potentially be subject to extensive regulation as a medical device under federal law.
In order to market a medical device, a company must first receive either FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The process of
obtaining PMA approval is much more rigorous, costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. In the 510(k)
clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device
legally on the market, known as a “predicate” device, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. To be
“substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and
either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics
and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required
to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and
effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical,
clinical trial, manufacturing, and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k)
process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk. Following FDA clearance or approval, medical devices
are subject to continuing regulatory requirements, including those related to manufacturing, labeling, advertising
and promotion, restrictions on sale, distribution and use, and surveillance of safety issues and product complaints.</p>

CLIA in order to perform testing on human specimens, unless they fall within an exception to CLIA certification, such as research
laboratories that test human specimens but do not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of
any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark> of individual patients. CLIA certification is also required to be
eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for diagnostic testing and
services. In addition, proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of an accredited program under CLIA so that they can be
offered in a CLIA-certified laboratory.</p>

and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products or

and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately,
with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The United States government, state legislatures and foreign
governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark>
care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded
prescription drugs or biologics. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products or
biologics through increased rebates for drugs or biologics reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid
managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’
share of sales to federal <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark> care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive
policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs or biologics.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers
to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> and Human Services
as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs or biologics furnished
to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’
rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer
price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such
as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate
liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug
rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to <mark data-esg="soc">pay</mark> rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population
potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the
United States as well.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries.
Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of
outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans
must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to <mark data-esg="soc">pay</mark>
for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and
at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class
of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription
drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription
drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products
covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the
MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment
limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction
in payments from non-governmental payors.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the
Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts
to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated
based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible
to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals,
these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug
prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described
above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As noted above, the marketability of any drug or biologic products
for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide
adequate coverage and reimbursement. An emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and we expect
will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change
at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing
for a drug or biologic must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug and biologic pricing
and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to
restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark> insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control
the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may
instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the
market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products
will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European
Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.</p>

employment agreements requiring our employees to continue in our employment for any period of time, with the exception of our Chief
Executive Officer, Dr. James A. Hayward. The initial term of Dr. Hayward’s current employment agreement is July 1, 2016 through
June 30, 2017, and this employment agreement automatically renews for one-year periods subject to ninety days’ prior notice
of non-renewal by Dr. Hayward or us in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement. As of June 30, 2019, the employment
contract automatically renewed for an additional year.</p>
