<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"><mark data-entity="date">Fiscal year 2019</mark> proved to be <mark data-entity="date">another adverse year</mark> in the agricultural sector. We have now seen <mark data-entity="date">five consecutive years</mark> of decreased net sales for our Agricultural Products segment. At <mark data-entity="date">the end of the third fiscal quarter</mark>, we found ourselves down <mark data-entity="percent">approximately 18%</mark> in net sales year on year in this segment. By end of the fourth fiscal quarter, we had closed this gap to only be a 6% decrease year on year. Our <mark data-entity="date">2019 fourth fiscal quarter</mark> had increased agricultural product sales of 59% year on year and the highest fourth quarter total since <mark data-entity="date">our 2014 fiscal year</mark>. <mark data-entity="date">This strong fourth quarter</mark> provides us renewed optimism about the state of the agricultural market. In <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>, we continued our continuous improvement projects including warehouse reorganization, improved product routings for efficiency and general cost cutting. These projects will improve our operational effectiveness and will allow us to thrive in periods of agricultural economic boom. Despite the struggles in our Agricultural Products segment, our diversification through different industries has helped us tremendously. Our Modular Building segment was profitable in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,mainly due a large contract that is <mark data-entity="percent">approximately 55%</mark> complete. This segment carries a strong backlog into 2020 that will provide a great start to our 2020 fiscal year. Our Tools segment did not have a strong year financially but did sign an <mark data-entity="org">OEM</mark> agreement that has the potential to increase their sales in <mark data-entity="date">the 2020 fiscal year</mark>.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Our consolidated balance sheet indicates a stable financial position as of November 30, 2019. Despite showing a net loss from continuing operations of $(1,420,000) for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,we were able to decrease our total liabilities by $735,000 compared to the 2018 fiscal year. Our total borrowings were reduced by $1,241,000 in <mark data-entity="date">fiscal year 2019</mark> compared to <mark data-entity="date">fiscal year 2018</mark>.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We expect to have access to capital as needed throughout 2020 through the sale of inventory and from the use our line of credit. At November 30, 2019 we had $2,421,470 available on our line of credit. Despite the continued losses, our banking relationship has remained positive through transparency and continued communication. Our working capital remained strong <mark data-entity="money">around $6,204,000</mark> in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,with a current ratio of 2.19, up <mark data-entity="cardinal">eight</mark> points from 2018. We continue to put emphasis on reducing our inventory to more manageable levels to decrease carrying costs, implement lean manufacturing practices and improve our inventory turnover. We do not foresee liquidity issues within <mark data-entity="date">the next twelve months</mark>.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 “<mark data-entity="work_of_art">Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</mark>” to our financial statements in “<mark data-entity="work_of_art">Item 8</mark>. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this report. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.</p>

Management monitors the carrying value of inventories using inventory control and review processes that include, but are not limited to, sales forecast review, inventory status reports, and inventory reduction programs. We record inventory write downs to net realizable value based on expected usage information for raw materials and historical selling trends for finished goods. If the assumptions made by management do not occur, we may need to record additional write downs.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers. The major sources of revenue for <mark data-entity="org">the Agricultural Products and Tools</mark> segments are farm equipment, service parts related to farm equipment and steel cutting tools and inserts. <mark data-entity="org">The Agricultural Products and Tools</mark> segments generally execute short-term contracts that contain a single performance obligation – the delivery of product to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the production and sale of farm equipment, service parts and cutting tools upon shipment of the goods. Shipment of the goods is the point in time when risk of ownership and title pass to the buyer. All sales are made to authorized dealers whose application for dealer status has been approved and who have been informed of general sales policies. Any changes in our terms are documented in the most recently published price lists. Pricing is fixed and determinable according to our published equipment and parts price lists. Title to all equipment and parts sold pass to the buyer upon delivery to the carrier and is not subject to a customer acceptance provision. Proof of the passing of title is documented by the signing of the delivery receipt by a representative of the carrier. Post shipment obligations are limited to any claim with respect to the condition of the equipment or parts. The agricultural products and tools segments each typically require payment in <mark data-entity="date">full 30 days</mark> after the ship date. To take advantage of program discounts, some customers pay deposits up front. Any deposits received are considered unearned revenue and increase contract liabilities.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">In certain circumstances, upon the customer’s written request, we may recognize revenue when production is complete, and the goods are ready for shipment. At the buyer’s request, we will bill the buyer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The buyer dictates that we ship the goods per their direction from our manufacturing facility, as is customary with this type of agreement, in order to minimize shipping costs. The written agreement with the customer specifies that the goods will be delivered on a schedule to be determined by the customer, with a final specified delivery date, and that we will segregate the goods from our inventory, such that they are not available to fill other orders. This agreement also specifies that the buyer is required to purchase all goods manufactured under this agreement. Title of the goods will pass to the buyer when the goods are complete and ready for shipment, per the customer agreement. At the transfer of title, all risks of ownership have passed to the buyer, and the buyer agrees to maintain insurance on the manufactured items that have not yet been shipped. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for <mark data-entity="date">many years</mark>, with consistent satisfactory results for both buyer and seller. The credit terms on this agreement are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All risks of loss are shouldered by the buyer, and there are no exceptions to the buyer’s commitment to accept and pay for these manufactured goods. Revenues recognized at the completion of production in the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years were <mark data-entity="money">approximately $16,000 and $202,000</mark>, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Our <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment is in the construction industry with its major source of revenue arising from modular building sales. Sales of modular buildings are generally recognized using input methods to measure progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation using the percentage of completion method. Revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Contract losses are recognized when current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss. Estimated contract costs include any and all costs appropriately allocable to the contract. The provision for these contract losses will be the excess of estimated contract costs over estimated contract revenues. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. We use significant judgements in determining estimated contract costs and completion percentages throughout the life of the project. Stock modular building sales also occur and are recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled through substantial completion. Substantial completion is achieved through customer acceptance of the completed building. The <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment executes contracts with customers that can be short- or long-term in nature. These contracts can have multiple performance obligations and revenue from these can be recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the contracts. Payment terms for the <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment vary by contract, but typically utilize money down and progress payments throughout the life of the contract. The payment terms of the <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment have the most impact on our contract receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities. Project invoicing from the <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment increases contract receivables and has an effect on contract liabilities through billings in excess of costs and estimated gross profit and advanced payments. The balance of contract assets is typically made up of the balance of costs in and estimated gross profit in excess of billings. Costs and profit in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets and billings in excess of cost and profit are classified as current liabilities.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We lease modular buildings to certain customers and account for these transactions as operating or sales-type leases. These leases have terms of <mark data-entity="date">up to 36 months</mark> and are collateralized by a security interest in the related modular building. On sales-type leases, the lessee has a bargain purchase option available at the end of the lease term. A minimum lease receivable is recorded net of unearned interest income and profit on sale at the time the building is substantially complete. Profit related to the sale of the building is recorded upon fulfillment of our obligation to the lessee. On operating leases, we recognize rent when the lessee has all the rights and benefits of ownership of the asset.</p>

The increase in revenue is due to a 133.5% increase in sales in our <mark data-entity="org">Modular Buildings</mark> segment due to the progress on a large contract. We experienced approximately a 6% and 7% decrease in sales in our Agricultural Products and Tools segments, respectively, for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>, Our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained fairly steady at 17.2% in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,when compared to 17.8% of net sales in the 2018 fiscal year.

The decreased loss is due to several factors. In <mark data-entity="date">the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year</mark> we recognized a loss of <mark data-entity="money">approximately $298,000</mark> from the <mark data-entity="gpe">revaluation</mark> of our deferred tax asset at the new income tax rates.

This facility required mold remediation of $235,000 and scrapping of $67,000 of inventory, which was captured in <mark data-entity="date">the third quarter of the 2018 fiscal year</mark>. We also impaired our goodwill on our <mark data-entity="org">Miller</mark> Pro product line in the amount of $375,000 in <mark data-entity="date">the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year</mark>. Moreover, in <mark data-entity="date">the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year</mark>. management decided to place increased reserves on inventory resulting in expense of <mark data-entity="money">approximately $543,000</mark>. The <mark data-entity="gpe">revaluation</mark> of our deferred tax asset, release of our current translation adjustment, impairment of assets and inventory reserve <mark data-entity="gpe">revaluation</mark> were all <mark data-entity="cardinal">one</mark>-time non-cash expenses that greatly impacted our bottom line in the 2018 fiscal year.

We saw decreased demand for our portable feed equipment in 2019, which resulted in decreased sales year on year of $1,329,000. Continued struggles in the dairy market, coupled with market shifts to large cattle operations from the traditional small cattle farmer also contributed to this decrease. Additionally, we also saw a decrease in sales of <mark data-entity="money">approximately $451,000</mark> in our <mark data-entity="facility">UHC</mark> reels year on year due to a loss of our primary reel customer after a strategic decision to not offer such customer discounted prices at unfavorable margins to us. Moreover, <mark data-entity="org">OEM</mark> blower revenue of <mark data-entity="money">approximately $262,000</mark> in the 2018 fiscal year was not repeated in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,as our <mark data-entity="org">OEM</mark> blower customer elected not to purchase any blowers from us in <mark data-entity="date">fiscal 2019</mark> due to slow-moving inventory on their dealer lots relating to poor agricultural market conditions. While we saw decreased demand in the above product lines, we saw increased demand in dump boxes, land maintenance equipment, bale processors and beet equipment for a combined $1,500,000 increase in sales. At <mark data-entity="date">the end of our third fiscal quarter of 2019</mark> our year to date sales were down 18.4% in this segment. <mark data-entity="date">Our strongest fourth quarter</mark> since <mark data-entity="date">the 2014 fiscal year</mark> brought us to within <mark data-entity="percent">approximately 6%</mark> of <mark data-entity="date">the 2018 fiscal year’s</mark> total.   Gross profit percentage for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,was 16.3% compared to 17.4% for the 2018 fiscal year. Our decreased gross profit percentage is due largely to a decrease in workforce efficiency. With the absence of steady demand for portable feed equipment, our most efficient equipment to build, we have struggled to gain operational efficiencies that are generally gained by continued production of a single product. Our efficiency has also been affected by the diversion of direct labor for operational changes that will have long-term benefits. We have partially completed warehouse reorganization, which we expect will improve inventory accuracy and decrease travel time for material handlers and machine operators. We have also implemented a material review board to decrease scrap and eliminate production errors. We believe our continued operational improvement projects will put us in a position to meet increased demand in an improved agriculture economy.</p>

These expenses were not repeated in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>, We also saw decreased selling expense in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,due to decreased commissions as a result of lower sales along with refocused marketing techniques. Our new marketing efforts include a shift to social media from more expensive print advertisements along with less participation in trade shows in <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>, This segment’s operating expenses for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,were 28.1% of sales compared to 34.6% of sales for the 2018 fiscal year.

The increase in sales was attributable to increased operating lease activity in 2019 and progress on a <mark data-entity="money">$8.5 million</mark> project. Gross profit for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,was 16.1% compared to 12.0% during the 2018 fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was largely due to increased revenue providing more variable margin to cover fixed costs.

The decrease is primarily due to the loss of a large volume customer near <mark data-entity="date">the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018</mark>. This segment began integration of an <mark data-entity="org">OEM</mark> product line at <mark data-entity="date">the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019</mark> that is expected to more than make up for the loss of this customer. Gross profit for <mark data-entity="date">the 2019 fiscal year</mark>,was 26.4% compared to 28.2% for the 2018 fiscal year. Our decreased gross margin for <mark data-entity="date">the twelve months</mark> is largely due to lower revenues with less variable margin to absorb fixed costs.

<p style='font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 18pt;'>We are subject to a number of trends and uncertainties that may affect our short-term or long-term liquidity, sales revenues, and operations. Similar to other farm equipment manufacturers, we are affected by items unique to the farm industry, including fluctuations in farm income resulting from the change in commodity prices, crop damage caused by weather and insects, government farm programs, interest rate fluctuations, and other unpredictable variables. Other uncertainties include our <mark data-entity="org">OEM</mark> customers and the decisions they make regarding their current supply chain structure, inventory levels, and overall business conditions. Management believes that our business is dependent on the farming industry for the bulk of our sales revenues. As such, our business tends to reap the benefits of increases in farm net income, as farmers tend to purchase equipment in lucrative times and forgo purchases in <mark data-entity="date">less profitable years</mark>. Direct government payments are declining and costs of agricultural production are increasing; therefore, we anticipate that further increases in the value of production will benefit our business, while any future decreases in the value of production will decrease farm net income and may harm our financial results.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">As with other farm equipment manufacturers, we depend on our network of dealers to influence customers’ decisions, and dealer influence is often more persuasive than a manufacturer’s reputation or the price of the product.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Sales of our agricultural products are seasonal; however, we have tried to decrease the impact of this seasonality through the development of beet harvesting machinery coupled with private labeled products, as the peak periods for these different products occur at different times.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We believe that our tool sales are not seasonal. Our modular building sales are somewhat seasonal, and we believe that this is due to the budgeting and funding cycles of the universities that commonly purchase our modular buildings. We believe that this cycle can be offset by building backlogs of inventory and by increasing sales to other public and private sectors.</p>
