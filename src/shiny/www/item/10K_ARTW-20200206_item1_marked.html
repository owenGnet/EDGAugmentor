<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Art’s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company”), began operations as a farm equipment manufacturer in 1956. Since that time, we have become a worldwide manufacturer of agricultural equipment, specialized modular science buildings and steel cutting tools. Our principal manufacturing plant is located in Armstrong, Iowa.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We have organized our business into three operating segments. Management separately evaluates the financial results of each segment because each is a strategic business unit offering different products and requiring different technology and marketing strategies. Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and distributes farm equipment under our own and private labels and previously included the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art’s-Way Manufacturing International LTD, a Canadian company (“International”). During the second quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, we liquidated our investment in our Canadian subsidiary by selling off remaining inventory and dissolving International. Our Modular Buildings segment manufactures modular buildings for various uses, commonly animal containment and research laboratories, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art’s-Way Scientific, Inc., an Iowa corporation. Our Tools segment manufactures standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Metal Working Products/Art’s Way, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Ohio Metal”). For detailed financial information relating to segment reporting, see Note 18 “Segment Information” to our financial statements in “Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this report.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;"><b> </b></p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">From our beginnings as a producer of portable grinder mixers, our Agricultural Products segment has grown through developing several new products and with our acquisitions. In 2012, we acquired the assets of Universal Harvester Co., Inc. (“UHC”) in Ames, Iowa and began selling reels for combines and swathers as UHC by Art’s-Way. In 2013, we acquired the Agro Trend product line based in Clifford, Ontario and we sold Agro Trend industrial snow blowers and agricultural trailers through our Canadian subsidiary. On December 15, 2017, we sold the Agro Trend product line to Metco, Inc. Today, our Agricultural Products segment manufactures a wide array of products relating to feed processing, crop production, augers, manure spreaders, hay and forage, tillage and <mark data-esg="env">land</mark> management, and sugar beet harvesting equipment. We primarily manufacture products under the Art’s-Way, Miller Pro, Roda, M&amp;W, Badger, and UHC by Art’s-Way brand names. Our Agricultural Products segment also maintains a small volume of OEM work for the industry’s leading manufacturers.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"><i>Grinder mixer line. </i>The grinder mixer line represents our original product line. Our founder, Arthur Luscombe, designed the original power take-off unit (“PTO”) powered grinder-mixer prior to our inception. Grinder mixers are used to grind grain and mix in proteins for animal feed. They have several agricultural applications and are commonly used in livestock operations. Our grinder mixers have wide swing radiuses to allow users to reposition the discharge tube from one side of the tank to the other in one step. Our 6105 grinder mixer offers a 105-bushel tank with a 20-inch hammermill. Our 6140 grinder mixer is a medium sized product with a 140-bushel tank, a 20-inch hammermill, and an 8-inch discharge auger. Our 7165 grinder mixer has a large 165- bushel tank with a 26-inch hammermill featuring self-contained hydraulics and 10-inch discharge augers yielding the fastest unload times in the industry. During the 2019 fiscal year, we completed development of the 8215 grinder mixer featuring a 215-bushel tank, which is now the largest in the industry. Our Cattle Maxx rollermill mixer products offer consistent feed grain rations for beef and dairy operations and are available in 105-bushel, 140-bushel, and 165-bushel capacities. We also offer the JR50 and JR75 grinder mixer models for smaller operations featuring 50- and 75-bushel mixing tanks, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"><i>Stationary feed grain processing line. </i>We offer stationary hammermills and rollermills. Harvesting leaves various amounts of extraneous materials that must be removed through processing the seeds. Hammermills are aggressive pre-cleaners that are designed to remove appendages, awns, and other chaff from seeds by vigorously scraping the seed over and through the screen. The screen has holes that are big enough to let the seed pass through undamaged but are small enough to catch and remove the appendages. Our rollermills roll the feed grain to minimize dust, and they fracture the outside hull to release the digestive juices more rapidly. Rolling feed provides more palatable and digestible feed for use in animal feeding operations.</p>

Our <mark data-esg="env">land</mark> planes have a patented Art’s-Way floating hitch design. We offer pull-type graders to help our customers perform many tasks such as maintaining terraces and waterways, leveling ground, cleaning ditches, and removing snow. The pull-type graders follow close to the back of a tractor for leveling uneven areas or for turning in smaller spaces.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"><i>Sugar beet harvesting line.</i> Our sugar beet defoliators and harvesters are innovative products in the industry due to our focus on continuous improvement, both in reaction to customer requests and in anticipation of our customers’ needs. Our machines can harvest six, eight, or twelve rows at one time. We were the first manufacturer to introduce a larger, 12-row harvester. We also manufacture a 692Z model, which is a smaller, more contained model, commonly used by smaller producers. Our sugar beet defoliators cut and remove the leaves of the sugar beets without damaging them, and the leaf particles are then incorporated back into the soil. In 2019, we introduced a sonar leveling axle to improve the harvesting capability of our beet equipment.</p>

This product line includes high capacity forage boxes for transporting hay from the field with optional running gear to provide superior <mark data-esg="gov">stability</mark> and tracking. With recent product line additions, we offer the highest capacity forage boxes on the market. High velocity, high volume forage blowers are able to fill the tallest silos with lower power requirements. Cam action rotary rakes will gently lift the crop, carry it to the windrow and release it, saving more leaves and forming a faster drying, fluffier windrow.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We distribute goods for our Agricultural Products segment primarily through a network of approximately 1,100 U.S. and Canadian <mark data-esg="gov">independent</mark> dealers, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia, whose customers require specialized agricultural machinery. We have sales representation in 48 states and seven Canadian provinces; however, many dealers sell only service parts for our products. Our dealers sell our products to various agricultural and commercial customers. We also maintain a local sales force in our Armstrong, Iowa facility to provide oversight services for our distribution network, communicate with end users, and recruit and train dealers on the uses of our products. Our local service parts staff is available to help customers and dealers with their service parts needs. Our Modular Buildings segment typically sells products customized to the end-user’s requirements directly to the end-user. Our Tools segment distributes products through manufacturers’ representatives, direct sales, and OEM sales channels.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We currently export products to eleven foreign countries. We have been shipping grinder mixers abroad since 2006 and have exported portable rollermills and sugar beet harvesters as well. We continue to strengthen these relationships and intend to develop new international markets. Our international sales accounted for 5.0% of consolidated sales during the 2019 fiscal year.</p>

As of January 30, 2020, our Tools segment had approximately $285,000 of backlog, our Modular Buildings segment had approximately $5,106,000 of backlog, and our Agricultural Products segment had a net backlog of approximately $3,592,000. Our backlog is up across all three segments and up approximately 266% in total compared to this same time last year. We expect that our order backlogs will continue to fluctuate as orders are received, filled, or cancelled, and, due to dealer discount arrangements we may enter into from time to time, these figures are not necessarily indicative of future revenue.</p>

<p style='font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 18pt;'>During the 2019 fiscal year, development in our Agricultural Products segment consisted of several products. We finalized design on the 8215 grinder mixer which incorporates the <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and traditional features of previous units with our largest capacity in a grinder mixer of 215 bushels. We introduced two new manure spreaders at the end of 2018, the X700 and X900. These units feature a guillotine slop gate for accurate metering and additional capacity due to flared sides. In 2019, we readied and put these units into mass production. We also developed a sonar leveling axle for our sugar beet harvesters in 2019 that tracks harvesting depth to maximize crop extraction. We continued development on our 40-foot commercial forage box, which features a rear unload, has an all-welded design for greater strength and features polished stainless-steel sides. The 40-foot forage box is also welded to a semi-trailer for straight from the field to over-the-road use. We also began the development of a hemp drying box in 2019.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">Management believes that grain and livestock producers, as well as those who provide services to grain and livestock operations, are the primary purchasers of agricultural equipment. Many factors influence a buyer’s choice for agricultural equipment. Any one or all factors may be determinative, but they include brand loyalty, the relationship with dealers, product <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and performance, product innovation, product availability, parts and warranty programs, price, and customer service.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">While our larger competitors may have <mark data-esg="env">resources</mark> greater than ours, we believe we compete effectively in the farm equipment industry by serving smaller markets in specific product areas rather than directly competing with larger competitors across an extensive range of products. Our Agricultural Products segment caters to niche markets in the agricultural industry. We do not have a direct competitor that has the same product offerings that we do. Instead, each of our product lines competes with similar products of many other manufacturers. Some of our product lines face greater competition than others, but we believe that our products are competitively priced with greater diversity than most competitor product lines. Other companies produce feed processing equipment, sugar beet harvesting and defoliating equipment, grinders, and other products similar to ours; therefore, we focus on providing the best product available at a reasonable price. Overall, we believe our products are competitively priced with above average <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and performance, in a market where price, product performance, and <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> are principal elements.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">In addition, in order to capitalize on brand recognition for our Agricultural Products segment, we have numerous product lines produced under our labels and private labels, and we have made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our dealer base. We also provide aftermarket service parts which are available to keep our branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the customer. We sell products to customers in the United States and eleven foreign countries through a network of approximately 1,100 <mark data-esg="gov">independent</mark> dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We believe that our <mark data-esg="gov">competitive</mark> pricing, product <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and performance, network of worldwide and domestic distributors, and strong market share for many of our products allow us to compete effectively in the agricultural products market.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We expect continued competition from our Modular Buildings segment’s existing competitors, which include conventional design/build firms, as well as competition from new entrants into the modular building market. To some extent, we believe barriers to entry in the modular building industry limit the competition we face in the industry. Barriers to entry in the market consist primarily of access to capital, access to a qualified <mark data-esg="soc">labor</mark> pool, and the bidding process that accompanies many jobs in the <mark data-esg="soc">health</mark> and education markets. Despite these barriers, manufacturers who have a skilled work force and adequate production facilities could adapt their manufacturing facilities to produce modular structures.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We believe the <mark data-esg="gov">competitive</mark> strength of our Modular Buildings segment is our ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms. Conventional design/build construction may take two to five years, while our modular laboratories can be delivered in as little as six months. As one of the few companies in the industry to supply turnkey modular buildings and laboratories, we believe we provide high-<mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> buildings at reasonable prices that meet our customers’ time, flexibility, and security expectations.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We expect competition in our Tools segment from off shore products that have gained market share over the last twenty years. Our greatest threat continues to be emerging technologies that replace the need for brazed tools. These <mark data-esg="gov">competitive</mark> threats are countered by our ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories to be found in North America. These inventories are strategically located in four warehouses across the United States, enabling our customers to receive product quickly with minimal shipping costs. Our ability to produce special, engineered, value-added products in volume with short lead times sets us apart from our competitors. This is most evident in certain segments of the pipe processing industry, where we have been able to establish and maintain market share despite efforts from companies significantly larger than ourselves. In 2019 we expanded our tool offering by entering into an OEM agreement with a specialty tool manufacturer.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We have an OEM supplier agreement with Case New Holland (“CNH”) for our Agricultural Products segment. Under the OEM agreement, we have agreed to supply CNH’s requirements for certain feed processing and service parts, primarily blowers, under CNH’s label. The agreement has no minimum requirements and can be cancelled upon certain conditions. The initial term of the agreement with CNH expired in September 2006, but the agreement continues in force until terminated or cancelled by either party. Neither party has terminated or cancelled the agreement as of November 30, 2019. We also sell reels to Honey Bee and Agco under an OEM agreement. For the 2019 fiscal year, sales to OEM customers were approximately 1% of consolidated sales compared to 5% in the 2018 fiscal year. <b> </b></p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:18pt;">We do not typically rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers. During the 2019 fiscal year, one customer accounted for more than 21% of consolidated revenues as the result of a large contract in our Modular Buildings segment. Our highest recurring customer accounted for just under 10% of our consolidated net revenues.</p>

We also have trademarks covering product identification. We believe our trademarks and licenses help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers. The duration of these rights ranges from 5 to 10 years, with options for renewal. We currently have no pending applications for intellectual property rights.</p>

In addition, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not expect that the cost of complying with these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.</p>
