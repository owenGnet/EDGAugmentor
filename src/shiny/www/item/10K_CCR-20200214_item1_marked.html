In addition, our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic <mark data-esg="soc">Behavior</mark> suitable for cokemaking, which enables us, if market dynamics are favorable, to capture greater margins from selling our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies.

     The design of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is optimized to produce large quantities of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, our technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods, with many of the approved permits as far out as ten years. We typically operate five longwalls and 15-17 continuous mining sections at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The current production capacity of our portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex’s five longwalls is 7.1 million tons of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> per year.  The preparation plant is connected via conveyor belts to each of our mines and cleans and processes up to 8,200 raw tons of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> per hour. Our on-site logistics infrastructure at the preparation plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 <mark data-esg="env">Clean</mark> tons of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs.

     /mmBtu of 3.8. Similar to the Enlow Fork Mine, the Harvey Mine was developed off of the Bailey Mine’s slope bottom. Once the slope for the Harvey Mine was placed into operation, seals were built to separate the two mines, and the original slope was dedicated solely to the Harvey Mine, which eliminated the need to make significant capital expenditures to develop, among other things, a new slope, air shaft and portal facility. Development of the Harvey Mine began in 2009, and construction of the supporting surface facilities commenced in 2011. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2014. For the years ended

We refer to the contracts under which <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is sold, which contracts are administered at our direction by a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL <mark data-esg="env">Energy</mark> under a contract agency agreement, as “our contracts”.  For 2020 and 2021, our contracted position, as of February 11, 2020, is at 95% and 43%, respectively, assuming an annual <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> sales volume at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our contracted position includes a mix of sales to our top domestic customers and to the thermal and metallurgical export markets, maintaining our diversified market exposure and providing a solid revenue base for meeting our long-term market strategy.

     The provisions of our contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of our contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, force majeure provisions, <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> qualities and quantities. Our contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>, <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> control, sampling and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> within stated ranges for specific <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatile matter content and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts.  Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the customers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits.

     Substantially all of our multi-year sales contracts contain base prices, subject only to pre-established adjustment mechanisms based primarily on (i) variances in the <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> characteristics of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> delivered to the customer beyond threshold <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> characteristics specified in the applicable sales contract, (ii) the actual calorific value of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> delivered to the customer, and/or (iii) changes in electric power prices in the markets in which our customers operate, as adjusted for any factors set forth in the applicable contract. The electric power price-related adjustments, if any, result only in positive monthly adjustments to the contracted base price that we receive for our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>. Price reopener provisions are present in several of our multi-year sales contracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price prospectively based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. In a limited number of agreements, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract.  Under some of our contracts, we have the right to match lower prices offered to our customers by other suppliers.  Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract.

     Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>.

     The <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> industry is highly <mark data-esg="gov">Competitive</mark>, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>. There are numerous large and small producers in all <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers, including those who export <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> abroad. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions and tariffs or other political and economic arrangements may benefit <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a <mark data-esg="gov">Competitive</mark> advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.

Demand for <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> are closely linked to <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> consumers. These <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark>, price and availability of competing sources of <mark data-esg="env">Fuel</mark>.

     Our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> and safety.

     . The federal <mark data-esg="env">Clean</mark> Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mining operations through permitting and <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> control requirements for the construction or modification of certain facilities. Indirectly, the CAA affects the U.S. <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired electric power generating plants or other industrial facilities operated by our customers.

     Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule
    </span>
<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     . In 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> and oil-fired power plants. NSPS are technology-based standards that vary depending on the particular source, such as a <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired electric generating plant, and can have a significant influence on the cost of using <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> as a <mark data-esg="env">Fuel</mark> source. The EPA's 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule (“MATS Rule”) established NSPS for emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (“SO

     ”) from <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired electric generating units (“EGUs”). The MATS Rule also established national <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> standards for hazardous air pollutants (“NESHAP”) for <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired electric generating units for certain impurities such as mercury. Unlike pollutants regulated by a NSPS, pollutants regulated by a NESHAP require the MACT be used to control emissions of the pollutant. The application of a MACT standard is generally more costly than other control technology standards, and prompted the closure of some facilities. The rule was challenged and ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 for failing to consider the costs imposed by the MATS Rule.  The rule was remanded to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) to determine whether to allow the EPA to address the rule’s deficiencies or to vacate and nullify the rule. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to stay the case to allow the agency to fully review the rule. Nevertheless, many <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-fired electric power generators have already taken steps to comply with the MATS Rule, as such required control and operational modifications can take significant time to install and/or implement. On December 27, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2016 supplemental cost finding for the MATS Rule, as well as the related risk and technology review required by the CAA. Under the proposal, the emissions standards and other requirements of the MATS Rule would remain in place while the EPA’s methodology for assessing the costs and benefits of the rule were being modified.

     National Ambient Air <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> Standards
    </span>
<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     . The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> Standards (“NAAQS”) for six pollutants considered harmful to public <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> and the environment (“Criteria Pollutants”). Areas that are not in compliance with these standards are considered “non-attainment areas.” In recent years, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for these Criteria Pollutants, which could directly or indirectly impact mining operations through the designation of new non-attainment areas which could prompt local changes to permitting or emissions control requirements, as prescribed by federally mandated state implementation plans that require <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> source identification and <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> reduction plans. Final rules may require significant investment in emissions control technologies by our customers in the electric power generation industry, and could affect the demand for our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>. For example, in 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone <mark data-esg="env">Pollution</mark> and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (“ppb”) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule was challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 7, 2017, the EPA advised the D.C. Circuit that it intended to reconsider the final rule and the Court subsequently stayed the litigation pending further action by the EPA. In August 2018, the EPA ultimately decided not to revisit the rule. As a result, the D.C. Circuit lifted its stay of the 2015 ozone NAAQS rule imposing the 70 ppb ambient air <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> standard while EPA reviews the standards under an expedited process. On October 31, 2019, EPA published a draft policy assessment recommending that the 70 ppb ozone NAAQS be retained. The policy assessment will be followed by a proposed rule finalizing the ozone NAAQS update on or before October 1, 2020.

     particulate matter and ozone in the District of Columbia and 27 states. CSAPR requires states to limit emissions from sources that “contribute significantly” to noncompliance with air <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> standards, such as electric power generating facilities. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in “nonattainment” for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In October 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to the CSAPR, known as the CSAPR Update Rule. Following litigation in the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, CSAPR was implemented in two phases: Phase 1 began in 2015 and Phase 2 began in 2017. On December 6, 2018, the EPA issued the CSAPR “Close-Out” Rule, a final determination that the CSAPR achieves requirements with respect to the 2008 ground-level ozone NAAQS in 20 states, and accordingly, those states will not be required to impose requirements for further reduction in transported ozone <mark data-esg="env">Pollution</mark>. In addition, the covered states do not need to submit state implementation plans (“SIPs”) that would establish additional requirements beyond the existing CSAPR update. The “Close-Out” rule was challenged by several states and other entities in the D.C. Circuit. In a September 13, 2019 ruling, the D.C. Circuit remanded the 2016 CSAPR Update Rule to EPA, finding that rule is inconsistent with the CAA. In a subsequent October 1, 2019 ruling, the CSAPR “Close-Out” rule was vacated.

The ACE rule directs states to develop specific SIPs to implement the rule, and provides six heat rate improvement technologies that may be considered by the states to establish <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> standards of performance on a plant-by-plant basis. States may also consider the remaining useful life of the EGUs, as provided by the CAA.  While the ACE rule reduces regulatory burden on <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> fired EGUs compared to the CPP, its ultimate effect on <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> demand is unknown. Several states and public interest groups have petitioned for review of the ACE rule in the D.C. Circuit. The EPA has requested for an expedited review of the challenges, seeking a resolution in the D.C. Circuit in 2020.

     National Environmental Policy Act.
    </span>
<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to taking a “major Federal action”, which encompasses agencies’ decisions on certain permitting applications that fall under federal jurisdiction. NEPA reviews require federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of their decisions, including those associated with GHG emissions and the effects of <mark data-esg="env">Climate</mark> change. Agencies must issue either an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment, which may create delays in project review and authorization timeframes, or increase the cost of compliance. In June 2018, the White House Council on Environmental <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> (“CEQ”) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on NEPA seeking to streamline the NEPA process, while also minimizing unnecessary litigation, cost and delay for project proponents. On June 26, 2019, CEQ published a “Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions” to replace guidance previously issued in 2016. The draft guidance seeks to clarify the scope of review federal agencies should undertake when considering the effects of GHG emissions under NEPA. A final proposed rule is expected to be published in 2020. Certain federal courts have held that GHGs must be considered under NEPA prior to a federal agency taking a “major Federal action,” and any modifications to NEPA will likely be subject to legal challenge.

     Since 2011, the EPA has required underground <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mines and certain support facilities exceeding a minimum GHG <mark data-esg="env">Emission</mark> threshold to report emissions annually under the Mandatory Reporting Rule. These emissions are currently classified as fugitive emissions associated with <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> extraction and are not currently regulated by the EPA. Previous petitions and judicial challenges seeking to compel the EPA to classify <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mines as stationary sources appropriate for regulation have been unsuccessful to date. If the EPA were to regulate <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mine methane emissions in the future, we would likely be required to install additional <mark data-esg="env">Pollution</mark> control devices, <mark data-esg="soc">Pay</mark> fees or taxes for our emissions, or incur expenses associated with the purchase of emissions credits, in order to continue operation. Alternatively, we may need to curtail <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> production.

     In the absence of sweeping federal legislation on GHG emissions in the United States, some states, governors, mayors and businesses have committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement or other broad GHG reduction initiatives. For instance, on October 3, 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued an Executive Order, “Commonwealth Leadership in Addressing <mark data-esg="env">Climate</mark> Change through Electric Sector Emissions Reductions,” directing the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to begin a rulemaking process that will allow Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”).

     (“ACOE”) under Section 404, as well as a corresponding permit from the state regulatory authority under Section 401 of the CWA. Alternatively, for specific categories of activities determined to have minimal effects, the Partnership may be required to obtain nationwide permits from the ACOE. All permits associated with the placement of dredge or fill material subject to minimum thresholds require appropriate mitigation. Permit holders must receive explicit authorization from ACOE before proceeding with mining activities, which could result in time or cost burdens to our operations.

<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     Additionally, the Partnership must obtain National <mark data-esg="env">Pollution</mark> Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits from the appropriate state or federal permitting authority under Section 402 of the CWA.  These permits establish effluent limitations for discharges to streams that are protective of <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> standards. For wastewater discharges to receiving waters that are classified as either high-<mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> or impaired, stringent restrictions are established to ensure anti-degradation and compliance with <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> standards. Permitting such discharges under NPDES could increase the cost, time, and difficulty of complying with permit requirements, and may warrant costly treatment that could affect our operations.

<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     Under the CWA, citizens may sue permit holders for alleged discharges of pollutants not explicitly limited by NPDES permits, or, citizens may sue to enforce NPDES permit requirements. Beginning in 2012, multiple citizen suits have been filed alleging violations of numeric and narrative <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> <mark data-esg="soc">Quality</mark> standards that broadly prohibit effects to aquatic life. The suits seek penalties and injunctive relief that could limit future discharges or impose expensive treatment technologies. While the outcome of these suits cannot be predicted, court rulings could result in additional treatment expenses that could affect our operations. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” regarding certain actions pertaining to our operations.

On February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order prompting the EPA and ACOE to consider replacing the blocked <mark data-esg="env">Clean</mark> <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> Rule. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the ACOE proposed a new regulation to determine which waterbodies are subject to federal jurisdiction. A final rule repealing the 2015 definition of “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) became effective on December 23, 2019. The repeal resets a consistent, nationwide regulatory standard to the previous pre-2015 regulations. A replacement rule that redefines WOTUS to comport with the text of the CWA is expected to be finalized in 2020.

     Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
    </span>
<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     . The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”) establishes minimum extraction, environmental, reclamation, and closure standards for mining activities. While SMCRA is a comprehensive statute, it does not supersede other major statutes such as the <mark data-esg="env">Clean</mark> Air Act, <mark data-esg="env">Clean</mark> <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> Act, Endangered Species Act and other statutes discussed herein. Operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (“OSM”) or from the applicable state agency where states have been granted regulatory primacy by demonstrating that the state’s regulatory program is at least as stringent as the federal program. Our active operations are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA, with oversight from OSM. The timing of permit issuance is largely at the discretion of the regulatory authorities and is related to the size and complexity of the operation seeking approval. Timing of permit issuance can also be influenced by public engagement in the permitting process, such as through comment, hearings, or legal interventions which could affect our operations. In addition, mining permits can be delayed, refused, or revoked if any entity under common ownership or control have unabated permit violations, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors, and principal owners of the entity seeking permit approval.

<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     Under federal and state laws, including SMCRA, we are required to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of our long-term obligations, including mine closure and reclamation, mine <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> treatment, federal and state workers’ <mark data-esg="gov">Compensation</mark> costs, <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> leases, or other miscellaneous obligations. Surety bonds are typically <mark data-esg="env">Renewable</mark> on a yearly basis and it is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral therefor. In recent years, surety bond costs have increased, the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable, and the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds has decreased. Any failure to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds required by state and federal laws or the related collateral required by bond issuers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, we posted an aggregated $89 million in surety bonds for reclamation purposes, as well as approximately $11 million in surety bonds, cash, and letters of credit to secure other obligations including workers <mark data-esg="gov">Compensation</mark>, <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> lease, and other obligations.

     In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore lands mined, closed, or abandoned before SMCRA's adoption in 1977, and to <mark data-esg="soc">Pay</mark> <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> Industry Retiree <mark data-esg="soc">Health</mark> Benefit Act of 1992. The current per ton fee is $0.12 per ton for underground mined <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>. This fee is currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021. We recognized expense related to Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund fees of approximately $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

     The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and other related federal and state statutes protect species that have been classified as endangered or threatened with possible extinction, or other protective designations. Protection of these species could prohibit or delay authorization of mining activities or may place additional restrictions on our operations related to timbering, construction, vegetation, or <mark data-esg="env">Water</mark> discharges. A number of species indigenous to our operating areas are protected under the ESA or other related laws and regulations; however, we do not believe the ESA would materially or adversely affect our mining operations under current approved mining plans. If more stringent or protective measures were required, or if additional critical habitat areas were designated, our operations could be exposed to additional requirements and expense, or delayed approval timeframes. In August 2018, the Department of the Interior issued three proposed rules intended to update and streamline the ESA as it relates to: (i) factors for the listing, delisting, or reclassifying of species, and the designation of critical habitat and (ii) the blanket extension of prohibitions for endangered species to threatened species. These rules, which became effective on September 26, 2019, are subject to challenge from several states and environmental groups.

     The Comprehensive Environmental Response <mark data-esg="gov">Compensation</mark> and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes remediation requirements related to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment.

<span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
     The federal Resource <mark data-esg="env">Conservation</mark> and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of certain wastes created throughout the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mining process. Facilities where certain regulated wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to RCRA and may receive corrective action orders for instances of non-compliance or in the event a hazardous substance is released to the environment.  Many <mark data-esg="env">Waste</mark> streams created throughout the mining process are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous <mark data-esg="env">Waste</mark>, and <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> operations authorized under SMCRA are exempt from RCRA permitting requirements. RCRA is particularly important in the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> industry because it regulates <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals  - byproducts of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion. In April 2015, the EPA published regulations under RCRA for the disposal of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals from electric utilities and <mark data-esg="gov">Independent</mark> power producers (the “<mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals rule”). Importantly, <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals are regulated under RCRA as “non-hazardous” <mark data-esg="env">Waste</mark> and avoid the stricter, costlier regulations under RCRA's “hazardous” <mark data-esg="env">Waste</mark> rules. In 2018, the EPA promulgated the first of a two-part rulemaking amending the national minimum criteria for existing and new <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals impoundments. The EPA released its second rulemaking proposal on December 19, 2019, to establish a federal permitting program for states and territories that do not have an approved permitting program for the disposal of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals in surface impoundments and landfills under RCRA. The <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals rule imposes new requirements at existing <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals impoundments and landfills that would generally increase the cost of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals management.  The combined effect of the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> combustion residuals rule and ELG regulations (discussed above) has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain older existing <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. Such retirements may adversely affect the demand for our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>.

     Since August 1, 2014, we have been subject to additional rules designed to lower miners’ exposure to respirable <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mine dust. Accordingly, we have been required to take full shift dust samples from the designated occupations and areas using the new continuous personal dust monitor (“CPDM”) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule.  Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 miners (<mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> miners who show evidence of the development of black lung disease).

     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner’s work. Second, it changed the law so that black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner’s death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.

     . The Partnership’s <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> business acquires ownership or leasehold rights to <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our <mark data-esg="env">Land</mark> records to determine control of <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> rights. Given our experience as a <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> control. Prior to the commencement of development operations on <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark> properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically <mark data-esg="soc">Responsible</mark> for the cost of curing any title defects. We have completed title work on substantially all of our <mark data-esg="env">Coal</mark>-producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.

     Additionally, under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Partnership also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” because its public float as of the last business day of the Partnership’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter was less than $250 million. For as long as the Partnership remains a “smaller reporting company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC’s reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not smaller reporting companies.
