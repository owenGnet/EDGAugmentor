Company continuously assesses the composition of its portfolio businesses to ensure it is aligned with its strategic objectives
and positioned to maximize growth and return in the coming years. During fiscal 2019, the Company made a strategic decision to
exit its Electronics Manufacturing group by selling all companies in that business segment on August 15, 2019. Accordingly, the
Company has reported the results of the Electronics Manufacturing business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied for all periods presented. During
fiscal 2019, the Company also reached a strategic decision to exit the environmental products business, which was part of Industrial

operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.</font></p>

ownership in the Company and proportional voting power remains unchanged after the Reverse Stock Split, except for minor changes
and adjustments resulting from the treatment of fractional shares. On June 13, 2019, the Reverse Stock Split became effective
and that trading in its common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Markets Exchange on a split-adjusted basis began on the morning of
June 13, 2019. All share amounts and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the prior periods
