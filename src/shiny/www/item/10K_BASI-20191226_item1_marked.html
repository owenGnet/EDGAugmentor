Inc. and its subsidiaries (“We,” “Our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “BASi”)
is a contract research organization ("CRO") that provides drug discovery and development services to the pharmaceutical,
chemical, and medical device industries, and sells analytical instruments to the pharmaceutical development and contract research
industries. Our mission is to provide product developers with superior scientific research and innovative analytical instrumentation
in order to bring revolutionary new products to market quickly and safely. Our strategy is to provide services that will generate
high-<mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and timely data in support of new product approval or expand their use. Our clients and partners include pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, biomedical device, academic and government organizations. We provide innovative technologies and products and a
commitment to <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> to help clients and partners accelerate the development of safe and effective products and maximize the returns
on their research and development investments. We offer an efficient, variable-cost alternative to our clients’ internal
product development programs. Outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed product approvals through the Food and
Drug Administration ("FDA") and other regulatory authorities is an established alternative to in-house product development
efforts. We derive our revenues from sales of our research services and instruments, both of which are focused on evaluating product
safety and efficacy. The Company has been involved in the research of products to treat diseases in numerous therapeutic areas
for over 45 years since its formation as a corporation organized in Indiana in 1974.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We support both the
non-clinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for primarily small molecule drug candidates, but also
including biotherapeutics and devices. Our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry, computer
software development, histology, pathology, physiology, medicine, surgery, analytical chemistry, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics,
and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients. Our principal
clients are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics
and basic research from small start-up biotechnology companies to many of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. We are committed
to bringing scientific expertise, <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and speed to every drug discovery and development program to help our clients develop
safe and effective life-changing therapies.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Developments
within the industries we serve have a direct, and sometimes material, impact on our operations. Currently, many large
pharmaceutical companies have major "blockbuster" drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections. This
puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market opportunity, and to re-evaluate
their cost structures and the time-to-market of their products. Contract research organizations have benefited from these
developments, as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out-sourcing to both reduce fixed costs and to increase the speed
of research and data development necessary for new product applications. The number of significant drugs that have reached or
are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry. Generic drug companies provide a
significant source of new business for CROs as they develop, test and manufacture their generic compounds.</p>

of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by smaller, venture capital funded drug discovery companies. Many
of these companies are "single-molecule" entities, whose success depends on one innovative compound. While several biotech
companies have reached the status of major pharmaceutical companies, the industry is still characterized by smaller entities. These
developmental companies generally do not have the <mark data-esg="env">resources</mark> to perform much of the research within their organizations, and are
therefore dependent on the CRO industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their regulatory submissions. These
companies have provided significant new opportunities for the CRO industry, including BASI. We believe that the Company is ideally
positioned to serve these clients as they look for alternatives to the large CROs that cater primarily to the large pharmaceutical
company segment of the marketplace.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Drug discovery and
development is the process of creating drugs for the treatment of human and animal disease. The drug discovery process aims to
identify potential drug candidates, while the drug development process involves the testing of these drug candidates in animals
and humans to meet requirements for regulatory approval. The process for researching and developing new medicines is growing in
difficulty and length. On average, it takes at least ten years for a new medicine to complete the journey from initial discovery
to the marketplace, with clinical trials alone taking six to seven years on average. The average cost to research and develop each
successful drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion. This number incorporates the cost of failures – of the thousands and sometimes
millions of compounds that may be screened and assessed early in the R&amp;D process, only a few will ultimately receive approval.
The overall probability of clinical success (the likelihood that a drug entering clinical testing will eventually be approved)
is estimated to be less than 10%.</p>

services industry provides <mark data-esg="gov">independent</mark> product development services to pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and
government organizations. This industry has evolved from providing limited clinical trial services in the 1970s to a full-service
industry today characterized by broader relationships with clients and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug development
process, including non-clinical efficacy and safety evaluations, study design, clinical trial management, data collection, biostatistical
analyses, regulatory consulting, clinical laboratory and diagnostic services, pre- and post-approval safety analysis, product
registration and post-approval support.</p>

technological advances, as well as the emergence of the biotechnology industry, have dramatically changed the drug discovery process.
New and improved technologies have evolved such as ultra-high-throughput screening, new in vitro and in vivo preclinical profiling
techniques and the gene-based drug research commonly referred to as genomics. The objective of these innovations is to find more
drug targets and to screen chemical compounds against targets much more quickly, with literally millions of compounds possible.
This process is expected to produce many more molecules having the ability to affect biological activity. These molecules then
need to be tested quickly and economically to determine their viability as potentially safe and effective drug candidates.</p>

as well as a small number of consolidating larger companies; the latter offer an ever-growing portfolio of start-to-finish pharmaceutical
development services. Our services and products may have distinctly different clients (including separate divisions in a single
large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. We believe that market trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries demonstrate
an increasing emphasis towards outsourcing, as companies seek to maintain reduced internal <mark data-esg="env">resources</mark> in favor of variable cost
models that offer high <mark data-esg="soc">quality</mark> and higher accountability alternatives to meet their drug discovery, development and manufacturing

industry is responding by consolidating, streamlining operations, decentralizing internal discovery and development processes,
and minimizing fixed costs. In addition, increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in
an increased focus on healthcare economics, safety monitoring and commercialization services. Moreover, pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes.</p>

allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know-how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse, global markets.
We believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing, many under study by small and virtual

will lead to more outsourcing and a dependence on small and virtual drug discovery efforts to feed their pipelines. Consolidation
may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug

information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity. A no observable adverse effect level is then
established for the drug and sets the basis for future safety testing and clinical phase I studies. Upon successful
completion of nonclinical safety studies, an IND submission is prepared and reviewed by FDA prior to initiation of human

tolerability and dosing regimens are established in patients in Phase II trials. Phase III clinical trials verify efficacy and
safety. After successful completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits a New Drug Application ("NDA")
or Biologics License Application ("BLA") to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. Early manufacturing
demonstrates production of the substance in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") guidelines. Data
are compiled in an NDA, or for biotechnology products a BLA, for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or
product. The bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from Phase I through Phase III. Phase II and III studies may take
several years to complete, supported by well-proven and consistently applied analytical methods.</p>
