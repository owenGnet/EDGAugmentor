    Based on a number of factors, including key scientific, clinical, and commercial considerations, for the past year the primary commercial focus for Cchek has been on developing a prostate cancer confirmatory test.  In February 2019, we formed a strategic alliance with ResearchDx, a CLIA certified, CAP Accredited laboratory, to prepare the Cchek Prostate Cancer Confirmation (Cchek PCC) test for launch as a laboratory developed test.  In December 2019, upon completion of <mark data-esg="gov">independent</mark> validation by ResearchDx, we announced the commercial launch of Cchek PCC.  We are currently conducting a number of activities to support the marketing of Cchek PCC, including the development of marketing materials, education of key opinion leaders in urology and development of a reimbursement path for the test.  We expect Cchek PCC to be broadly available throughout the U.S. by April 2020.

    In November 2017, we formed a subsidiary, Certainty Therapeutics, Inc. (Certainty), to develop immuno-therapy drugs against cancer.  Certainty entered into a license agreement with Wistar pursuant to which Certainty was granted an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Wistar relating to Wistars chimeric endocrine receptor targeted therapy technology (such technology being akin to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technology).  We have initially focused on the development of a treatment for ovarian cancer, but we also may pursue future applications of the technology for the development of treatments for additional solid tumors.  The license agreement requires Certainty to make certain cash and equity payments to Wistar upon achievement of specific development milestones.  With respect to Certaintys equity obligations to Wistar, Certainty issued to Wistar shares of its common stock equal to five percent (5%) of the common stock of Certainty.

    Our Cchek cancer detection platform measures a patient's immune response to a malignancy by detecting the presence, absence, and quantity of certain immune cells that can be found in the blood stream.  These types of cells and the tumor micro-environment have been the focus of ground breaking published and reported research in immuno-oncology, enabling the development of revolutionary immunotherapies used for treating certain cancer types.  We have developed proprietary techniques and protocols for measuring the subtle immunological changes that occur in the blood stream during tumor development.  Specifically, we seek to identify a subset of myeloid cells that we believe are diagnostic.  These cells, often referred to as Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), are identified by specific surface proteins enabling characterization.  We generally refer to MDSCs and other cells of the immune system which we believe can be diagnostic in nature as biomarkers.  Through our proprietary protocols, we have had early success and have demonstrated accuracy in detecting these biomarkers in the peripheral blood of biopsy verified cancer patients, and in distinguishing the blood of healthy patients from the blood of cancer patients.  We utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically a Neural Network (NN) to analyze our data and to determine the presence of a tumor.  We believe that a NN is better able to identify subtle changes in immune response than other analytical approaches.  The distinguishing feature of a NN is that it can be trained to answer the key biological questions of interest, in our case whether or not the patient is tumor-bearing, and as it is trained with more data, its ability to answer these questions may improve.  Our goal is to establish Cchek as a non-invasive, inexpensive, cancer diagnostic blood test that can reduce or eliminate the need for traditionally expensive, invasive, painful, and often inaccurate cancer diagnostic procedures which are currently in use.

    In each instance where we have demonstrated the efficacy of our cancer detection platform, fresh (utilized within 48 hours) blood samples from biopsy verified cancer patients have been tested using a variety of experimental methodologies and protocols, including the use of certain over the counter reagents and other supplies.  Such un-blinded, non-uniform testing is common during the initial development stage of new technologies and diagnostic tests.  Blood samples from patients with differing severities of cancers (with some cancers such as breast cancer stage I to stage IV) have been tested, including samples from both pre-treatment and post-treatment patients.  In addition, we have also tested blood from healthy donors.  A critical aspect of any cancer diagnostic is the ability to accurately distinguish patients with cancer from healthy patients.  Based upon our encouraging results, we continue working to refine protocols and methodologies for identifying and classifying the immunologic biomarkers that are the foundation for our Cchek early cancer detection platform.

    While studies comparing biopsy verified cancer patients to healthy donors are critical, it is also vital to evaluate the impact of benign conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, non-malignant neoplasias, systemic inflammatory conditions, infections, and other potential conditions on the immune system.  We have performed such testing comparing cancer patients to those with benign conditions in the development of Cchek PCC, as patients in need of a confirmatory test will not likely be healthy, but instead will have either prostate cancer or a benign condition.

    As we develop our Cchek platform, there are multiple regulatory approval pathways available for each test.  One manner of seeking regulatory approval is to have a lab certified to run our diagnotic tests pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, CLIA).  Among other things, CLIA requires clinical laboratories that perform diagnostic testing to be certified by the state in which the lab is located, as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  If we seek regulatory approval pursuant to CLIA, only those laboratories that are certified under CLIA to run our diagnostic test would be able to process test samples.  CLIA certification may or may not require additional studies.  We could seek to establish our own CLIA certified laboratory to run the diagnostic tests, or we could potentially contract with an existing CLIA certified lab and seek to have that laboratory certified to run our diagnostic test.

    Another manner of obtaining regulatory approval would be to seek to have our diagnostic test approved by the FDA pursuant to what are commonly referred to as either the 510(K) process, or the Premarket Application (PMA) process.  The appropriate pathway for FDA approval would depend upon a variety of factors, including the intended use of the test, and the risks associated with such use.  FDA approval can take several years and would entail additional clinical studies.

    While we believe our Cchek platform could eventually form the basis of a pan-cancer (all cancer) test, the decision to initially focus on a prostate cancer confirmation test incorporated a number of factors, including key scientific, clinical, and commercial considerations.  The current method of diagnosing prostate cancer is highly inaccurate, with approximately 75% of all prostate biopsies in the U.S. being negative for high risk cancer.  Our most recently reported studies with Cchek PCC have demonstrated sensitivity of 92%, meaning 92% of all men with prostate cancer may be correctly diagnosed with cancer, and specificity of 41%, meaning 41% of all men without cancer may be correctly diagnosed as not having cancer.  With approximately 1-1.5 million prostate biopsies performed annually, Cchek PCC has the potential to eliminate hundreds of thousands of unnecessary prostate biopsies annually in the U.S. alone.

    Sensitivity and specificity are scientific measurements commonly used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test, where sensitivity measures how good a test is at identifying people with a particular disease, and specificity measures how good a test is at identifying people without the disease.  Although published results vary widely, established diagnostic tests such as Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT), which is used by other companies to screen for lung cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 93% and specificity of approximately 73%, the PSA test, which is used by other companies to screen for prostate cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 21% and specificity of approximately 91%, and mammography, used by other companies to screen for breast cancer and considered to be the gold standard for breast cancer screening, has reported sensitivity as low as approximately 68% and specificity as low as approximately 75%.  As these results indicate, current diagnostic testing is hampered by low sensitivity, low specificity or both, meaning that the tests miss a substantial portion of the cancers they are supposed to detect, or miss-diagnose a large number of healthy patients as having cancer.  There is currently no inexpensive, non-invasive, diagnostic test that excels in both sensitivity and specificity.

    Screening occurs when asymptomatic people are tested for indications of cancer. Examples of existing screening tests include the mammogram for breast cancer, PSA for prostate cancer, and colonoscopy for colon cancer.  All screening tests have their strengths and weaknesses, and for many cancers there are currently no recommended screening tests available.

    Confirmatory testing is used to confirm the results of a screening test.  In certain instances, existing confirmatory testing can be invasive, painful, expensive, and have relatively high risks of complications.  For example, a positive mammogram is often followed up with additional imaging, which can lead to a biopsy during which a needle is inserted into the breast to sample suspicious tissue or lesions.  For lung cancer, existing confirmatory diagnostics include bronchoscopies, during which a flexible tube is inserted through the nose or mouth and into the lung, and needle biopsies, during which a long needle is inserted between the ribs and into the lung.  One potential side effect of a lung biopsy is a pneumothorax (commonly referred to as a collapsed lung), which has been reported to occur in approximately fifteen percent (15%) of needle biopsies of the lung.  A pneumothorax can lead to other complications and sometimes requires extended hospitalization.  In addition to the potential side effects, biopsies of any sort can be extremely painful for the patient.

    Treatment monitoring includes follow-on testing to monitor the effectiveness of a specific regimen of treatment.  For example, diagnostic monitoring testing may be used to monitor the effectiveness of a particular type of chemotherapy, to determine how the cancer is responding and whether such treatment should be continued.  Often, imaging techniques are not able to identify whether a treatment is working, so a biopsy is useful, however it is painful and impractical to perform multiple biopsies on a patient.  Therefore, a liquid biopsy enabling therapy monitoring via a blood test can be useful.

    Continuing scientific advances and discoveries, the ability to more quickly process and analyze large amounts of scientific data, and decreases in the cost of sophisticated equipment and technologies, have resulted in the potential for significant advances in cancer treatment, and in particular, cancer diagnostics.  Cancer statistics gathered over the past several decades provide overwhelming evidence that the earlier that cancers are detected, the greater the survival rates.  Up until now, doctors have primarily relied upon technologies such as imaging (x-rays, mammograms, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans, ultrasounds) and biopsies and other invasive procedures for cancer detection and cancer diagnoses.  In many cases, these diagnostic procedures were performed after patients exhibited one or more symptoms of cancer, at which point the cancer may likely no longer be at an early stage.  Existing diagnostic technologies such as imaging have gotten better, and invasive diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies have become more accurate and less risky, and we expect these types of traditional diagnostic tools to continue to predominate the cancer diagnostic market for the foreseeable future.

    If successful, we believe Cchek will have several advantages over existing diagnostic technologies.  For example, repeated exposure to radiation from x-ray technologies, such as mammograms, has become an increasing concern for the medical <mark data-esg="soc">community</mark>, causing authorities to re-evaluate the recommended frequency of such x-ray based tests.  Traditional biopsies are often impossible for some cancers depending on the location of the tumor, and are invasive, expensive, and painful enough to warrant only limited use for other cancers even when the tumor can be accessed.  In addition, such biopsies are limited in their inability to detect the heterogeneity of many cancerous tumors, and the ongoing mutations that are often evident as the tumor progresses.  False positives in existing testing such as the PSA test, result in otherwise healthy patients being misdiagnosed, and subject to unnecessary follow-on treatments and medical procedures.  Patient inconvenience, risk of side effects from anesthesia, and risk of other complications result in low patient compliance with otherwise effective cancer screening tests such as the colonoscopy.  These are just a few examples of the challenges with traditional diagnostic tests that we seek to eliminate with Cchek.  This will be the foundation for the <mark data-esg="gov">competitive</mark> advantages that we expect to have over existing diagnostic testing.  We expect Cchek will be utilized as a component of multiple diagnostic technologies and patient background information to diagnose and manage the patients condition.

    Many public and private companies have announced plans and ongoing research efforts to launch non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests and tools that can be used for non-invasive cancer testing.  These companies include well established, and successful biotech companies, start-ups, and companies of all sizes.  Almost every bodily fluid, including blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and excrement, are being studied for biomarkers or indicators of one or more types of cancer.  The term that has been used to describe the category of this type of non-invasive cancer diagnostic testing is liquid biopsy.  In general, most of these companies are focused on identifying and analyzing one of three types of biomarkers:  circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and exosomes.  Each of these types of biomarkers has their advantages and disadvantages, and we expect that tests incorporating these and other biomarkers will make their way into the cancer diagnostic marketplace.

    We believe that our Cchek diagnostic platform has the potential for at least three distinct advantages over the types of biomarker tests referred to above.  First, it appears that the biomarkers that we are using may be present in multiple types of and varying severities of cancers.  As a result, we anticipate that Cchek will become a platform from which multiple tests could be launched for multiple types of cancers.  Second, it appears that the biomarkers utilized by Cchek may be present in both advanced, and early stages of cancers.  Third, we expect Cchek to be significantly less expensive than the technologies commonly used for tests based on CTCs, ctDNA, and exosomes.

    While Cchek PCC was commercially launched in December 2019, there are a number of activities we are currently conducting to support marketing of the test, including the development of marketing materials, education of key opinion leaders in urology and development of a reimbursement path for the test.  We anticipate that once these activities are completed, we will have a team of key opinion leaders in urology using Cchek PCC in parallel with the standard methods of prostate cancer diagnosis.  We believe that we will demonstrate to such key opinion leaders that Cchek PCC provides significantly greater diagnostic accuracy than standard methods, as well as improved patient care.  We therefore believe that with favorable clinical experience amongst key opinion leaders in urology using Cchek PCC, we will be positioned to execute a strategic partnership with national or regional testing laboratories for the sales, marketing and operations of Cchek PCC.

    CAR-T therapeutics have demonstrated positive results in B-cell cancers, but very little progress has been made on solid tumors.  Our CAR-T technology is initially focused on ovarian cancer and is based on engineering killer T-cells with the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) to target ovarian cells that express the FSH-Receptor.  Data on this technology, including the animal studies showing efficacy, was published in January 2017 in the journal, Clinical Cancer Research.  The FSH-Receptor has been shown to be a very exclusive protein found on a large percentage of ovarian cancer cells, but not on a significant number of non-ovarian healthy tissues in adult females.

    According to American Cancer Society statistics, ovarian cancer accounts for just 2.5% of all female cancer cases, but 5% of cancer deaths in women due to the diseases low survival rate.  It is estimated that in 2019, 23,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,000 American women will die from this disease.  Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need, as the overall five-year relative survival rate for ovarian cancer patients is 47%.  However, ovarian cancer survival varies substantially by age, with the overall five-year survival rate for women 65 and older of only 30%.

    We licensed certain technology from Cleveland Clinic to develop vaccines for the treatment or prevention of TNBC and other breast cancers which express the α-lactalbumin protein.  This protein is only expressed during lactation in healthy women, but may also be expressed in individuals with certain breast cancers, most notably TNBC, the most lethal form of breast cancer.

    Typically, vaccines harness the immune system to protect people from infectious diseases.  Broad-based vaccination programs have essentially eliminated some of the most deadly and debilitating diseases in history, small pox and polio among them.  However, there has been little success developing a preventative (prophylactic) vaccine against cancer.

    Vaccines work by exposing a benign form of a disease agent to an individuals immune system.  The immune system identifies the agent and learns to attack and destroy it, retaining a memory of the agent so the immune system knows to react quickly if an individual is exposed to the disease agent months or years later.

    Most vaccines attack pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria.  The immune system is better able to assail these agents because they come from outside the body.  Cancer, however, is caused by aberrant cells that arise out of our resident cells, which can make it difficult for our immune system to find the diseased cells, especially as advancing age weakens our immune system.  Once these aberrant cells gain critical mass, they become cancer.

    Despite the lack of success with cancer vaccines, recently gained knowledge about the human immune system has led to the development, approval and commercialization of revolutionary immuno-therapy drugs.  These drugs do not attack cancer directly, but rather modulate the immune system in ways that enable it to destroy or dramatically impair cancer cells.

    The technology licensed from Cleveland Clinic has identified a protein called alpha-lactalbumin that is present in healthy breast tissue only when a woman is lactating and disappears when she stops nursing her child.  Alpha-lactalbumin is never present on any other cell in the body.  However, it does show up in many types of breast cancer, including TNBC, an aggressive and deadly form of the disease.  By developing a vaccine that targets alpha-lactalbumin, we feel the immune system can destroy these breast cancer cells as they arise and ultimately prevent breast tumors from forming.

    Cleveland Clinic researchers have demonstrated in animal studies that vaccination against alpha-lactalbumin completely prevented breast cancer in mice that were specifically bred to develop breast cancer.  Data on this technology, including the animal studies showing efficacy, was published in March 2016 in the journal, Cancers.
