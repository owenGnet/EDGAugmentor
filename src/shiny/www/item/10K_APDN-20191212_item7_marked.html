<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Using our large scale <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> based manufacturing platform, we manufacture
large quantities of linear DNA for various markets. Whether for supply chain security, brand protection, law enforcement or drug
or biologic applications, it is our goal to help establish secure flourishing environments that foster quality, integrity and success.
With secure taggants, high-resolution DNA authentication, and comprehensive reporting, our <mark data-entity="org">SigNature</mark>® molecular tag technologies
are designed to deliver what we believe to be the greatest levels of security, deterrence and legal recourse strength. Under our
98% owned subsidiary, <mark data-entity="org">LineaRx, Inc.</mark> (“<mark data-entity="org">LRx</mark>”), we supply DNA for use in the <i>in vitro</i> medical diagnostics,
preclinical biotechnology and preclinical drug and biologic development and manufacturing markets. We are also engaged in preclinical
and animal drug candidate development, directly and with collaborators, focusing on therapeutically relevant DNA constructs manufactured
via our <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> based DNA production platform.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">To date, the substantial portion of our revenues has
been generated from sales of our <mark data-entity="org">SigNature</mark>® and <mark data-entity="org">SigNature</mark>® T molecular tags, our principal supply chain security
and product authentication solutions. We expect to grow revenues from sales of our <mark data-entity="org">SigNature</mark>® molecular tags, <mark data-entity="org">SigNature</mark>® T molecular tags, <mark data-entity="org">SigNify</mark>® and CertainT® offerings as we work with companies and governments to secure
supply chains for various types of products and product labeling throughout the world. In addition, we expect to continue to
grow revenues from <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> produced linear DNA products and services using our patented <mark data-entity="org">Triathlon</mark>™ and other proprietary <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> production and post-processing systems. We have continued to incur expenses in expanding our business to meet current and
anticipated future demand. We have limited sources of liquidity. Our products and services are offered in <mark data-entity="gpe">the United States</mark>,
<mark data-entity="loc">Europe</mark> and <mark data-entity="loc">Asia</mark>. At the present time, we are focusing our efforts on textile and apparel, pharmaceuticals and
nutraceuticals, microcircuits and other electronics, legal cannabis and <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> produced linear DNA products for use in
biotherapeutic applications, as well as services for <i>in vitro</i> medical diagnostics, preclinical biotechnology research
and preclinical biotherapeutic manufacturing. Currently, <mark data-entity="percent">approximately 35%</mark> of our annual revenue comes from the textile
market. The basic technology we use in various markets is very similar, and we believe our solutions are adaptable for many
types of products and markets. In the future, we plan to expand our focus to include additional consumer products, food and
beverage and industrial materials. The cotton ginning season in <mark data-entity="gpe">the United States</mark>,takes place <mark data-entity="date">between September and March</mark>
<mark data-entity="date">each year</mark>; therefore, revenues from our cotton customer contracts may be <mark data-entity="date">seasonal</mark> and recognized primarily during our first

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, we seek to develop, acquire and commercialize,
ourselves or with partners, a diverse portfolio of nucleic acid-based drugs and biologics based on <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> produced linear DNA to improve
existing nucleic acid-based therapeutics or to create new nucleic acid-based therapeutics that address unmet medical needs. We
are also engaged in preclinical and animal drug candidate development activities focusing on therapeutically relevant DNA constructs
manufactured through our large scale <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> production systems.“<mark data-entity="org">LRx</mark>”uses its <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> systems to rapidly produce customized DNA for use
by our contract research organization/contract manufacturing organization clients, our preclinical drug and biologic clients and
partners, and for our own nucleic acid-based preclinical drugs and biologics under development in the field of <mark data-entity="product">CAR T</mark>-cell immunotherapy.“<mark data-entity="org">LRx</mark>”s proprietary processes enables large, <mark data-entity="cardinal">gram</mark>-scale production of DNA through <mark data-entity="org">PCR</mark> for bio-based therapeutics, adoptive
cell therapies, vaccines (including cancer), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or <mark data-entity="org">CRISPR</mark> and other nucleic
acid-based therapies. <mark data-entity="org">Linear</mark> DNA does not require recombination, therefore, there is no need for a virus or for plasmids. This
reduces the risk of unwanted DNA or other contaminants that would need to be removed.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the <mark data-entity="org">SEC</mark>, recommends
that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements.
While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these
policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: left">In <mark data-entity="date">May 2014</mark>, the <font style="background-color: #F9F9F9"><mark data-entity="org">Financial
Accounting Standards Board</mark> (“</font><mark data-entity="work_of_art">FASB</mark>”) issued accounting standard updates which clarified principles for recognizing
revenue arising from contracts with customers (“<mark data-entity="law">ASC 606</mark>” or “<mark data-entity="work_of_art">Topic 606</mark>”) and superseded most current revenue
recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue standard is that an entity recognizes
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance applies a five-step model for revenue measurement
and recognition and also requires increased disclosures including the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows related to contracts with clients.</p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"> </p>
<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: left">The Company adopted the new revenue standard
at <mark data-entity="date">the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019</mark>, using the modified retrospective method of adoption and applied the guidance
to those contracts that were not completed as of September 30, 2018. Comparative financial information for reporting periods beginning
prior to <mark data-entity="date">October 1, 2018</mark>, has not been restated and continues to be reported under the previous reporting guidance. Under the modified
retrospective method of adoption, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recorded at the date of initial application,
with no restatement of the comparative prior periods presented. Based on the evaluation, the Company has identified certain customer
contracts, which will require different recognition under the new guidance. The Company has determined that the revenue under certain
of its research and development contracts should be recognized on an over time basis using the input method as compared to <mark data-entity="person">ratably</mark>
over the contract term. Also, the shipment to the Company’s cotton customer during <mark data-entity="date">fiscal 2018</mark> that included extended payment
terms and was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2018, would have met the criteria under the new guidance to be recognized
as revenue upon shipment. The Company has determined that the cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings in fiscal 2019
was <mark data-entity="money">approximately $493,000</mark>.</p>

revenue at the amounts that reflect the consideration to which it is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring control

performance obligations to customers are satisfied. The Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance
obligations (e.g. taggants, maintenance, authentication services, research and development services, etc.). For such arrangements,
the Company allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price.</p>

stock-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and are recognized as
expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value
of the Company’s common stock options are estimated using the <mark data-entity="org">Black Scholes</mark> option-pricing model with the
following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company
expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with <mark data-entity="product">ASC 718</mark>, excess tax benefits realized
from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified as cash flows from operating activities. All excess tax benefits and

on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The most complex
and subjective estimates include revenue recognition, recoverability of long-lived assets, including the values assigned to goodwill,
intangible assets and property and equipment, fair value calculations for stock based compensation and convertible promissory notes,
contingencies, allowance for doubtful accounts and management’s anticipated liquidity. Management reviews its estimates on
a regular basis and the effects of any material revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period
